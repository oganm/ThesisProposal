  abstract = {Summary
Effective approaches to neuropsychiatric disorders require detailed understanding of the cellular composition and circuitry of the complex mammalian brain. Here, we present a paradigm for deconstructing the diversity of neurons defined by a specific neurotransmitter using a microfluidic dynamic array to simultaneously evaluate the expression of 96 genes in single neurons. With this approach, we successfully identified multiple molecularly distinct dopamine neuron subtypes and localized them in the adult mouse brain. To validate the anatomical and functional correlates of molecular diversity, we provide evidence that one Vip+ subtype, located in the periaqueductal region, has a discrete projection field within the extended amygdala. Another Aldh1a1+ subtype, located in the substantia nigra, is especially vulnerable in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of Parkinson's disease. Overall, this rapid, cost-effective approach enables the identification and classification of multiple dopamine neuron subtypes, with distinct molecular, anatomical, and functional properties.},

  abstract = {Summary
Our understanding of current treatments for depression, and the development of more specific therapies, is limited by the complexity of the circuits controlling mood and the distributed actions of antidepressants. Although the therapeutic efficacy of serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is correlated with increases in cortical activity, the cell types crucial for their action remain unknown. Here we employ bacTRAP translational profiling to show that layer 5 corticostriatal pyramidal cells expressing p11 (S100a10) are strongly and specifically responsive to chronic antidepressant treatment. This response requires p11 and includes the specific induction of Htr4 expression. Cortex-specific deletion of p11 abolishes behavioral responses to SSRIs, but does not lead to increased depression-like behaviors. Our data identify corticostriatal projection neurons as critical for the response to antidepressants, and suggest that the regulation of serotonergic tone in this single cell type plays a pivotal role in antidepressant therapy.},

  doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btr323},
  abstract = {Motivation: Sample mix-ups can arise during sample collection, handling, genotyping or data management. It is unclear how often sample mix-ups occur in genome-wide studies, as there currently are no post-hoc methods that can identify these mix-ups in unrelated samples. We have therefore developed an algorithm (MixupMapper) that can both detect and correct sample mix-ups in genome-wide studies that study gene expression levels.
Results: We applied MixupMapper to five publicly available human genetical genomics datasets. On average, 3\% of all analyzed samples had been assigned incorrect expression phenotypes: in one of the datasets 23\% of the samples had incorrect expression phenotypes. The consequences of sample mix-ups are substantial: when we corrected these sample mix-ups, we identified on average 15\% more significant cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs). In one dataset, we identified three times as many significant cis-eQTLs after correction. Furthermore, we show through simulations that sample mix-ups can lead to an underestimation of the explained heritability of complex traits in genome-wide association datasets.

LPL is also present in the brain, where its function has remained elusive. Recent evidence implicates a role of LPL in the brain in two processes: (a) the regulation of energy balance and body weight and (b) cognition. Mice with neuron-specific deletion of LPL have increases in food intake that lead to obesity, and then reductions in energy expenditure that further contribute to and sustain the phenotype. In other mice with LPL deficiency rescued from neonatal lethality by somatic gene transfer wherein LPL in the brain remains absent, altered cognition ensues. Taking into consideration data that associate LPL mutations with Alzheimer's disease, a role for LPL in learning and memory seems likely. Overall, the time is ripe for new insights into how LPL-mediated lipoprotein metabolism in the brain impacts CNS processes and systems biology.},

To this end, we compare two large compendia of transcriptional profiles of human and mouse immune cell types. Global transcription profiles are conserved between corresponding cell lineages. The expression patterns of most orthologous genes are conserved, particularly for lineage-specific genes. However, several hundred genes show clearly divergent expression across the examined cell lineages, and among them, 169 genes did so even with highly stringent criteria. Finally, regulatory mechanisms--reflected by regulators' differential expression or enriched cis-elements--are conserved between the species but to a lower degree, suggesting that distinct regulation may underlie some of the conserved transcriptional responses.},

We developed a novel, fast, and inexpensive method to quantify total numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the brain or any dissectable regions thereof. It consists of transforming highly anisotropic brain structures into homogeneous, isotropic suspensions of cell nuclei, which can be counted and identified immunocytochemically as neuronal or non-neuronal. Estimates of total cell, neuronal, and non-neuronal numbers can be obtained in 24 h and vary by \ensuremath{<}10\% among animals. Because the estimates obtained are independent of brain volume, they can be used in comparative studies of brain-volume variation among species and in studies of phylogenesis, development, adult neurogenesis, and pathology. Applying this method to the adult rat brain, we show, for example, that it contains \ensuremath{\sim}330 million cells, of which 200 million are neurons, and almost 70\% of these are located in the cerebellum alone. Moreover, contrary to what is commonly assumed in the literature, we show that glial cells are not the majority in the rat brain.},

  abstract = {Combining large-scale gene expression approaches and bioinformatics may provide insights into the molecular variability of biological processes underlying neurodegeneration. To identify novel candidate genes and mechanisms, we conducted a multiregional gene expression analysis in postmortem brain. Gene arrays were performed utilizing Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 gene chips. Brain specimens from 21 different brain regions were taken from Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 22) and normal aged (n = 23) brain donors. The rationale for conducting a multiregional survey of gene expression changes was based on the assumption that if a gene is changed in more than one brain region, it may be a higher probability candidate gene compared to genes that are changed in a single region. Although no gene was significantly changed in all of the 21 brain regions surveyed, we identified 11 candidate genes whose pattern of expression was regulated in at least 18 out of 21 regions. The expression of a gene encoding the mitochondria ribosomal protein S6 (MRPS6) had the highest combined mean fold change and topped the list of regulated genes. The analysis revealed other genes related to apoptosis, cell signaling, and cell cycle that may be of importance to disease pathophysiology. High throughput gene expression is an emerging technology for molecular target discovery in neurological and psychiatric disorders. The top gene reported here is the nuclear encoded MRPS6, a building block of the human mitoribosome of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). Impairments in mitochondrial OXPHOS have been linked to the pathogenesis of PD.},

Median follow-up was 18 years.Setting~Individual data drawn from Danish longitudinal registers.Participants~A total of 176~347 persons born from January 1, 1955, through December 31, 1991, were followed up from their first contact with secondary mental health services after 15 years of age until death, emigration, disappearance, or the end of 2006. For each participant, 5 matched control individuals were included.Main Outcome Measures~Absolute risk of suicide in percentage of individuals up to 36 years after the first contact.Results~Among men, the absolute risk of suicide (95\% confidence interval [CI]) was highest for bipolar disorder, (7.77\%; 6.01\%-10.05\%), followed by unipolar affective disorder (6.67\%; 5.72\%-7.78\%) and schizophrenia (6.55\%; 5.85\%-7.34\%). Among women, the highest risk was found among women with schizophrenia (4.91\%; 95\% CI, 4.03\%-5.98\%), followed by bipolar disorder (4.78\%; 3.48\%-6.56\%). In the nonpsychiatric population, the risk was 0.72\% (95\% CI, 0.61\%-0.86\%) for men and 0.26\% (0.20\%-0.35\%) for women. Comorbid substance abuse and comorbid unipolar affective disorder significantly increased the risk. The co-occurrence of deliberate self-harm increased the risk approximately 2-fold. Men with bipolar disorder and deliberate self-harm had the highest risk (17.08\%; 95\% CI, 11.19\%-26.07\%).Conclusions~This is the first analysis of the absolute risk of suicide in a total national cohort of individuals followed up from the first psychiatric contact, and it represents, to our knowledge, the hitherto largest sample with the longest and most complete follow-up. Our estimates are lower than those most often cited, but they are still substantial and indicate the continuous need for prevention of suicide among people with mental disorders.},

We generated a transcriptome database for these eight cell types by RNA sequencing and used a sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each cell type. Bioinformatic analyses identified thousands of new cell type-enriched genes and splicing isoforms that will provide novel markers for cell identification, tools for genetic manipulation, and insights into the biology of the brain. For example, our data provide clues as to how neurons and astrocytes differ in their ability to dynamically regulate glycolytic flux and lactate generation attributable to unique splicing of PKM2, the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. This dataset will provide a powerful new resource for understanding the development and function of the brain. To ensure the widespread distribution of these datasets, we have created a user-friendly website (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres\_lab/brain\_rnaseq.html) that provides a platform for analyzing and comparing transciption and alternative splicing profiles for various cell classes in the brain.},

The single gene variants that have been shown to associate reproducibly with complex diseases typically have small effect sizes or attributable risks. However, the joint actions of common gene variants within pathways may play a major role in predisposing to complex diseases (the paradigm of complex genetics). The goal of this study was to determine whether polymorphism in a candidate pathway (axon guidance) predisposed to a complex disease (Parkinson disease [PD]). We mined a whole-genome association dataset and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were within axon-guidance pathway genes. We then constructed models of axon-guidance pathway SNPs that predicted three outcomes: PD susceptibility (odds ratio = 90.8, p = 4.64 x 10(-38)), survival free of PD (hazards ratio = 19.0, p = 5.43 x 10(-48)), and PD age at onset (R(2) = 0.68, p = 1.68 x 10(-51)). By contrast, models constructed from thousands of random selections of genomic SNPs predicted the three PD outcomes poorly. Mining of a second whole-genome association dataset and mining of an expression profiling dataset also supported a role for many axon-guidance pathway genes in PD. These findings could have important implications regarding the pathogenesis of PD. This genomic pathway approach may also offer insights into other complex diseases such as Alzheimer disease, diabetes mellitus, nicotine and alcohol dependence, and several cancers.},

  abstract = {BackgroundInhibitory innervation by parvalbumin (PV) expressing interneurons has been implicated in the onset of the sensitive period of visual plasticity. Immunohistochemical analysis of the development and plasticity of these inhibitory inputs is difficult because PV expression is low in young animals and strongly influenced by neuronal activity. Moreover, the synaptic boutons that PV neurons form onto each other cannot be distinguished from the innervated cell bodies by immunostaining for this protein because it is present throughout the cells. These problems call for the availability of a synaptic, activity-independent marker for PV+ inhibitory boutons that is expressed before sensitive period onset. We investigated whether synaptotagmin-2 (Syt2) fulfills these properties in the visual cortex. Syt2 is a synaptic vesicle protein involved in fast Ca2+ dependent neurotransmitter release. Its mRNA expression follows a pattern similar to that of PV throughout the brain and is present in 30\textendash{}40\% of hippocampal PV expressing basket cells. Up to now, no quantitative analyses of Syt2 expression in the visual cortex have been carried out.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe used immunohistochemistry to analyze colocalization of Syt2 with multiple interneuron markers including vesicular GABA transporter VGAT, calbindin, calretinin, somatostatin and PV in the primary visual cortex of mice during development and after dark-rearing.Conclusions/SignificanceWe show that in the adult visual cortex Syt2 is only found in inhibitory, VGAT positive boutons. Practically all Syt2 positive boutons also contain PV and vice versa. During development, Syt2 expression can be detected in synaptic boutons prior to PV and in contrast to PV expression, Syt2 is not down-regulated by dark-rearing. These properties of Syt2 make it an excellent marker for analyzing the development and plasticity of perisomatic inhibitory innervations onto both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex.},

  abstract = {Schizophrenia is associated with alterations in working memory that reflect dysfunction of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) circuitry. Working memory depends on the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells in DLPFC layer 3 and, to a lesser extent, in layer 5. Although many studies have profiled gene expression in DLPFC gray matter in schizophrenia, little is known about cell-type-specific transcript expression in these two populations of pyramidal cells. We hypothesized that interrogating gene expression, specifically in DLPFC layer 3 or 5 pyramidal cells, would reveal new and/or more robust schizophrenia-associated differences that would provide new insights into the nature of pyramidal cell dysfunction in the illness. We also sought to determine the impact of other variables, such as a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder or medication use at the time of death, on the patterns of gene expression in pyramidal neurons. Individual pyramidal cells in DLPFC layers 3 or 5 were captured by laser microdissection from 36 subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and matched normal comparison subjects. The mRNA from cell collections was subjected to transcriptome profiling by microarray followed by quantitative PCR validation. Expression of genes involved in mitochondrial (MT) or ubiquitin\textendash{}proteasome system (UPS) functions were markedly downregulated in the patient group (P-values for MT-related and UPS-related pathways were \ensuremath{<}10-7 and \ensuremath{<}10-5, respectively). MT-related gene alterations were more prominent in layer 3 pyramidal cells, whereas UPS-related gene alterations were more prominent in layer 5 pyramidal cells. Many of these alterations were not present, or found to a lesser degree, in samples of DLPFC gray matter from the same subjects, suggesting that they are pyramidal cell specific. Furthermore, these findings principally reflected alterations in the schizophrenia subjects were not present or present to a lesser degree in the schizoaffective disorder subjects (diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder was the most significant covariate, P\ensuremath{<}10-6) and were not attributable to factors frequently comorbid with schizophrenia. In summary, our findings reveal expression deficits in MT- and UPS-related genes specific to layer 3 and/or layer 5 pyramidal cells in the DLPFC of schizophrenia subjects. These cell type-specific transcriptome signatures are not characteristic of schizoaffective disorder, providing a potential molecular\textendash{}cellular basis of differences in clinical phenotypes.},

  abstract = {The cerebellar cortex consists of a small set of neuronal cell types interconnected in a highly stereotyped way. While the development of cerebellar cortical projection neurons, i.e. Purkinje cells, and that of granule cells has been elucidated in considerable detail, that of cerebellar cortical inhibitory interneurons is still rather fragmentarily understood. Here, we use mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the Pax2 locus to analyse the ontogenesis of these cells. Numbers of Pax2-positive inhibitory interneuronal precursors increase following a classical sigmoidal growth curve to yield a total of some 905.000~\ensuremath{\pm}~77.000~cells. Maximal cell increase occurs at about postnatal day (P)5.4, and some 75\% of all inhibitory interneurons are generated prior to P7. Conjoint analysis of the developmental accruement of Pax2-GFP-positive cells and their cell cycle distribution reveals that, at least at P0 and P3, the numerical increase of these cells results primarily from proliferation of a Pax2-negative precursor population and suggests that Pax2 expression begins at or around the final mitosis. Following their terminal mitosis, inhibitory cerebellar cortical interneurons go through a protracted quiescent phase in which they maintain expression of the cell cycle marker Ki-67. During this phase, they translocate into the nascent molecular layer, where they stall next to premigratory granule cell precursors without penetrating this population of cells. These observations provide a quantitative description of cerebellar cortical inhibitory interneuron genesis and early differentiation, and define Pax2 as a marker expressed in basket and stellate cells, from around their final mitosis to their incipient histogenetic integration.},

Here we describe methods for the prospective isolation and purification of astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes from developing and mature mouse forebrain. We used FACS (fluorescent-activated cell sorting) to isolate astrocytes from transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of an S100\ensuremath{\beta} promoter. Using Affymetrix GeneChip Arrays, we then created a transcriptome database of the expression levels of \ensuremath{>}20,000 genes by gene profiling these three main CNS neural cell types at various postnatal ages between postnatal day 1 (P1) and P30. This database provides a detailed global characterization and comparison of the genes expressed by acutely isolated astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. We found that Aldh1L1 is a highly specific antigenic marker for astrocytes with a substantially broader pattern of astrocyte expression than the traditional astrocyte marker GFAP. Astrocytes were enriched in specific metabolic and lipid synthetic pathways, as well as the draper/Megf10 and Mertk/integrin \ensuremath{\alpha}v\ensuremath{\beta}5 phagocytic pathways suggesting that astrocytes are professional phagocytes. Our findings call into question the concept of a ``glial'' cell class as the gene profiles of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are as dissimilar to each other as they are to neurons. This transcriptome database of acutely isolated purified astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes provides a resource to the neuroscience community by providing improved cell-type-specific markers and for better understanding of neural development, function, and disease.},

  abstract = {The nature of cerebral cortical circuitry has been increasingly clarified by markers for the identification of precise cell types with specific morphology, connectivity and distinct physiological properties. Molecular markers are not only helpful in dissecting cortical circuitry, but also give insight into the mechanisms of cortical neuronal specification and differentiation. The two principal neuronal types of the cerebral cortex are the pyramidal and GABAergic cells. Pyramidal cells are excitatory and project to distant targets, while GABAergic neurons are mostly inhibitory non-pyramidal interneurons. Reliable markers for specific subtypes of interneurons are available and have been employed in the classification and functional analysis of cortical circuitry. Until recently, cortical pyramidal neurons have been considered a homogeneous class of cells. This concept is now changing as the powerful tools of molecular biology and genetics identify molecular tags for subtypes of pyramidal cells such as: Otx-1 [Frantz, G.D., Bohner, A.P., Akers, R.M., McConnell, S.K., 1994.

These genes outline the numerous subtypes of pyramidal cells and are increasingly refining our previous classifications. They also indicate specific developmental programs operate in cell fate decisions. This review will describe the progress made on the correlation of these markers to each other within a specific subtype of layer V neurons with identified, stereotypic projections. Further work is needed to link these data with observations on somatodendritic morphology and physiological properties. The integrated molecular, anatomical and physiological characterisation of pyramidal neurons will lead to a much better appreciation of functional cortical circuits.},

These changes include general leukopenia, activation of B and T cells, and maturation of granulocytes. The manifestation of SLE in peripheral blood is central to the disease but is incompletely understood. A technique for rigorously characterizing changes in mixed populations of cells, microarray expression deconvolution, has been applied to several areas of biology but not to SLE or to blood. Here we demonstrate that microarray expression deconvolution accurately quantifies the constituents of real blood samples and mixtures of immune-derived cell lines. We characterize a broad spectrum of peripheral leukocyte cell types and states in SLE to uncover novel patterns including: specific activation of NK and T helper lymphocytes, relationships of these patterns to each other, and correlations to clinical variables and measures. The expansion and activation of monocytes, NK cells, and T helper cells in SLE at least partly underlie this disease's prominent interferon signature. These and other patterns of leukocyte dynamics uncovered here correlate with disease severity and treatment, suggest potential new treatments, and extend our understanding of lupus pathology as a complex autoimmune disease involving many arms of the immune system.},

  abstract = {Besides dopaminergic (DA-ergic) neurons having all enzymes of DA synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), ``monoenzymatic'' neurons expressing only one of them were found in the brain, mostly in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH). The aim of this study was to test our hypothesis that DA is synthesized by monoenzymatic neurons, i.e. l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), which produced in the monoenzymatic TH neurons is transported in the monoenzymatic AADC neurons for DA synthesis. Incubation of MBH in Krebs-Ringer solution with l-leucine, a competitive inhibitor of l-DOPA uptake, was used to prevent a hypothetical l-DOPA capture into AADC-containing neurons. Incubation of the substantia nigra containing DA-ergic neurons under the same conditions served as the control. According to our data, the l-leucine administration provoked a decrease of DA concentration in MBH and in the incubation medium but not in the substantia nigra and respective incubation medium, showing a decrease of cooperative synthesis of DA in MBH. This conclusion was supported by an observation of higher concentration of l-DOPA in the incubation medium under perfusion of MBH with Krebs-Ringer solution containing tolcapone, an inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase, and l-leucine than under perfusion with the same solution, but without l-leucine. Functional interaction between monoenzymatic TH and AADC neurons was indirectly confirmed by finding in electron microscopy their close relations in MBH. Besides monoenzymatic AADC neurons, any AADC-possessing neurons, catecholaminergic and serotoninergic, apparently, could participate in DA synthesis together with monoenzymatic TH neurons. This idea was confirmed by the observation of close topographic relations between monoenzymatic TH neurons and those containing both enzymes, i.e. DA-ergic, noradrenergic or adrenergic. Thus, monoenzymatic neurons possessing TH or AADC and being in close topographic relations can synthesize DA in cooperation.},

  abstract = {Methods were developed to evaluate the stability of rat whole blood expression obtained from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and assess changes in whole blood transcriptome profiles in experiments replicated over time. Expression was measured in globin-depleted RNA extracted from the whole blood of Sprague-Dawley rats, given either saline (control) or neurotoxic doses of amphetamine (AMPH). The experiment was repeated four times (paired control and AMPH groups) over a 2-year span. The transcriptome of the control and AMPH-treated groups was evaluated on: 1) transcript levels for ribosomal protein subunits; 2) relative expression of immune-related genes; 3) stability of the control transcriptome over 2 years; and 4) stability of the effects of AMPH on immune-related genes over 2 years. All, except one, of the 70 genes that encode the 80s ribosome had levels that ranked in the top 5\% of all mean expression levels. Deviations in sequencing performance led to significant changes in the ribosomal transcripts. The overall expression profile of immune-related genes and genes specific to monocytes, T-cells or B-cells were well represented and consistent within treatment groups. There were no differences between the levels of ribosomal transcripts in time-matched control and AMPH groups but significant differences in the expression of immune-related genes between control and AMPH groups. AMPH significantly increased expression of some genes related to monocytes but down-regulated those specific to T-cells. These changes were partially due to changes in the two types of leukocytes present in blood, which indicate an activation of the innate immune system by AMPH. Thus, the stability of RNA-seq whole blood transcriptome can be verified by assessing ribosomal protein subunits and immune-related gene expression. Such stability enables the pooling of samples from replicate experiments to carry out differential expression analysis with acceptable power.},

CRISPR-Cas9 is a versatile genome editing technology for studying the functions of genetic elements. To broadly enable the application of Cas9 in~vivo, we established a Cre-dependent Cas9 knockin mouse. We demonstrated in~vivo as well as ex~vivo~genome editing using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-, lentivirus-, or particle-mediated delivery of guide RNA in neurons, immune cells, and endothelial cells. Using these mice, we simultaneously modeled the dynamics of KRAS, p53, and LKB1, the top three significantly mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma. Delivery of a single AAV vector in the lung generated loss-of-function mutations in p53 and Lkb1, as well~as homology-directed repair-mediated KrasG12D mutations, leading to macroscopic tumors of adenocarcinoma pathology. Together, these results suggest that Cas9 mice empower a wide range of biological and disease modeling applications.},

  abstract = {Pluripotent stem cells can be derived from preimplantation and postimplantation mouse embryos. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from blastocysts are in a ``naive'' pluripotent state and meet all of the criteria for pluripotency, including the ability to generate live pups through tetraploid complementation. Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) derived from postimplantation epiblasts are in a ``primed'' pluripotent state. ESCs and EpiSCs show different phenotypes and gene expression patterns, and EpiSCs are thought to be less pluripotent than ESCs. In this study, we addressed whether EpiSCs can be differentiated into specialized cell types in vitro. To do this, we first derived EpiSCs from E5.5\textendash{}6.5 mouse embryos containing the Oct4-GFP transgene. We found that EpiSCs expressed pluripotency markers and differentiated into all three germ layers in intro and in vivo. Interestingly, EpiSCs also efficiently differentiated into a homogenous population of neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro. The EpiSC-derived NSCs (EpiSC-NSCs) expressed NSC markers (Nestin, Sox2, and Musashi), self-renewed for more than 20 passages, and differentiated into neuronal and glial neural cell subtypes in vitro. We then transplanted the EpiSC-NSCs into the neonatal mouse brains, and found that they were able to survive and differentiate into robust neurons and glial cells in the mouse brains, demonstrating that primed pluripotent EpiSCs efficiently form functional NSCs. We compared the global gene expression patterns of NSCs differentiated from EpiSC-NSCs, ESCs, and brain tissue and found that the expression patterns of most genes, including pluripotency and NSC specificity, were similarly clustered, but that the developmental process-related genes were distantly clustered. Moreover, the global gene expression pattern of brain-derived NSCs was more similar to that of ESC-derived NSCs than that of EpiSC-derived NSCs. Taken together, these results indicate that although NSCs, regardless of their origins, display very similar in vitro and in vivo differentiation properties, their global gene expression profiles may differ, depending on the pluripotency state, i.e., naive or primed.},

  abstract = {Objective
To determine whether brain white matter hyperintensities (WMH) influence l-dopa response in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.
Methods
We prospectively evaluated 60 PD patients with an acute l-dopa challenge test, and assessed motor performance with the Movement Disorders Society revised Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) during ``ON'' and ``OFF'' medication states. Magnetic resonance images were examined using a visual semi-quantitative rating scale for quantification and distribution analysis of WMH. l-dopa challenge test response was correlated to extent and location of WMH, to determine a potential association between them.
Results
Subjects with greater deep WMH burden, showed less response to l-dopa on axial motor symptoms (R~=~-0.35; p~\&lt;~0.027), when tested with Part III of the MDS-UPDRS before and after acute levodopa challenge.
Conclusions
Results suggest WMH may affect response to l-dopa on axial function of PD patients, which could be due to either non-dopaminergic (cortico-basal ganglia) motor pathway disruption, or postsynaptic nigrostriatal pathway involvement.},

  abstract = {Gene expression analysis is generally performed on heterogeneous tissue samples consisting of multiple cell types. Current methods developed to separate heterogeneous gene expression rely on prior knowledge of the cell-type composition and/or signatures - these are not available in most public datasets. We present a novel method to identify the cell-type composition, signatures and proportions per sample without need for a-priori information. The method was successfully tested on controlled and semi-controlled datasets and performed as accurately as current methods that do require additional information. As such, this method enables the analysis of cell-type specific gene expression using existing large pools of publically available microarray datasets., Gene expression microarrays are widely used to uncover biological insights. Most microarray experiments profile whole tissues containing mixtures of multiple cell-types. As such, gene expression differences between samples may be due to different cellular compositions or biological differences, highly limiting the conclusions derived from the analysis. All current approaches to computationally separate the heterogeneous gene expression to individual cell-types require that the identity, relative amount of the cell-types in the tissue or their individual gene expression are known. Publically available microarray-based datasets, which include thousands of patient samples, do not usually measure this information, rendering existing separation methods unusable. We developed a novel approach to estimate the number of cell-types, identities, individual gene expression and relative proportions in heterogeneous tissues with no a-priori information except for an initial estimate of the cell-types in the tissue analyzed and general reference signatures of these cell-types that may be easily obtained from public databases. We successfully applied our method to microarray datasets, yielding highly accurate estimations, which often exceed the performance of separation methods that require prior information. Thus, our method can be accurately applied to any heterogeneous dataset, where re-examination and analysis of the individual cell-types in the heterogeneous tissue can aid in discovering new aspects regarding these diseases.},

  abstract = {The search for genetic variants underlying major depressive disorder (MDD) has not yet provided firm leads to its underlying molecular biology. A complementary approach is to study gene expression in relation to MDD. We measured gene expression in peripheral blood from 1848 subjects from The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Subjects were divided into current MDD (N=882), remitted MDD (N=635) and control (N=331) groups. MDD status and gene expression were measured again 2 years later in 414 subjects. The strongest gene expression differences were between the current MDD and control groups (129 genes at false-discovery rate, FDR\ensuremath{<}0.1). Gene expression differences across MDD status were largely unrelated to antidepressant use, inflammatory status and blood cell counts. Genes associated with MDD were enriched for interleukin-6 (IL-6)-signaling and natural killer (NK) cell pathways. We identified 13 gene expression clusters with specific clusters enriched for genes involved in NK cell activation (downregulated in current MDD, FDR=5.8 \texttimes{} 10-5) and IL-6 pathways (upregulated in current MDD, FDR=3.2 \texttimes{} 10-3). Longitudinal analyses largely confirmed results observed in the cross-sectional data. Comparisons of gene expression results to the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) MDD genome-wide association study results revealed overlap with DVL3. In conclusion, multiple gene expression associations with MDD were identified and suggest a measurable impact of current MDD state on gene expression. Identified genes and gene clusters are enriched with immune pathways previously associated with the etiology of MDD, in line with the immune suppression and immune activation hypothesis of MDD.},

It is expressed by neurons throughout the nervous system of a variety of species, including birds, rodents, and man (Mullen et al. [1992] Development 116:201\textendash{}211). When we sought to use NeuN to follow the developmental progression of murine cerebellar interneurons, we observed that expression of this antigen in the cerebellum was restricted to granule neurons and a small population of cells present in the lower molecular layer of the adult cerebellum. In an attempt to identify these cells, we combined immunostaining for NeuN with a panel of cell type-specific markers to unambiguously identify neurons that express NeuN in the adult and developing cerebellum. In contrast to postmitotic granule neurons, NeuN was not expressed by any other immunocytochemically identified cerebellar interneurons, which comprised basket and stellate cells, Golgi neurons, unipolar brush cells, and Lugaro cells. NeuN-positive cells in the molecular layer failed to express any cell type-specific markers tested. They may represent ectopic granule cells; alternatively, they may represent a hitherto unknown population of cerebellar cells. In vitro experiments suggest that NeuN expression is related closely to granule cell axogenesis. This approach also revealed that the level of NeuN expression could be modulated by chronically depolarizing these cells. Thus, whereas NeuN expression per se is a reliable marker of proliferative capacity, levels of NeuN expression may also be indicative of the physiological status of a postmitotic neuron. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  volume = {6},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0017540},
  abstract = {Background
Neural induction of human pluripotent stem cells often yields heterogeneous cell populations that can hamper quantitative and comparative analyses. There is a need for improved differentiation and enrichment procedures that generate highly pure populations of neural stem cells (NSC), glia and neurons. One way to address this problem is to identify cell-surface signatures that enable the isolation of these cell types from heterogeneous cell populations by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).

Methodology/Principal Findings
We performed an unbiased FACS- and image-based immunophenotyping analysis using 190 antibodies to cell surface markers on na{\"\i}ve human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and cell derivatives from neural differentiation cultures. From this analysis we identified prospective cell surface signatures for the isolation of NSC, glia and neurons. We isolated a population of NSC that was CD184+/CD271-/CD44-/CD24+ from neural induction cultures of hESC and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). Sorted NSC could be propagated for many passages and could differentiate to mixed cultures of neurons and glia in vitro and in vivo. A population of neurons that was CD184-/CD44-/CD15LOW/CD24+ and a population of glia that was CD184+/CD44+ were subsequently purified from cultures of differentiating NSC. Purified neurons were viable, expressed mature and subtype-specific neuronal markers, and could fire action potentials. Purified glia were mitotic and could mature to GFAP-expressing astrocytes in vitro and in vivo.

Conclusions/Significance
These findings illustrate the utility of immunophenotyping screens for the identification of cell surface signatures of neural cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells. These signatures can be used for isolating highly pure populations of viable NSC, glia and neurons by FACS. The methods described here will enable downstream studies that require consistent and defined neural cell populations.},

Manyof these relationships provide strong evidence for the involvement of new genes in core biological functions such as the cell cycle, secretion, and protein expression. We experimentallyconfirmed the predictions implied bysome of these links and identified cell proliferation functions for several genes. By assembling these links into a gene-coexpression network, we found several components that were animal-specific as well as interrelationships between newly evolved and ancient modules.

Comparative analysis can provide important insights into complex biological systems.

To establish the generality of this approach, we present translational profiles for 24 CNS cell populations and identify known cell-specific and enriched transcripts for each population. We report thousands of~cell-specific mRNAs that were not detected in whole-tissue microarray studies and provide examples that demonstrate the benefits deriving from comparative analysis. To provide a foundation for further biological and in~silico studies, we provide a resource of 16 transgenic mouse lines, their corresponding anatomic characterization, and translational profiles for cell types from a variety of central nervous system structures. This resource will enable a wide spectrum of molecular and mechanistic studies of both well-known and previously uncharacterized neural cell populations.},

Gliomas are thought to form by clonal expansion from a single cell-of-origin, and progression-associated mutations to occur in its progeny cells. Glioma progression is associated with elevated growth factor signaling and loss of function of tumor suppressors Ink4a, Arf and Pten. Yet, gliomas are cellularly heterogeneous; they recruit and trap normal cells during infiltration.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We performed lineage tracing in a retrovirally mediated, molecularly and histologically accurate mouse model of hPDGFb-driven gliomagenesis. We were able to distinguish cells in the tumor that were derived from the cell-of-origin from those that were not. Phenotypic, tumorigenic and expression analyses were performed on both populations of these cells. Here we show that during progression of hPDGFb-induced murine gliomas, tumor suppressor loss can expand the recruited cell population not derived from the cell-of-origin within glioma microenvironment to dominate regions of the tumor, with essentially no contribution from the progeny of glioma cell-of-origin. Moreover, the recruited cells can give rise to gliomas upon transplantation and passaging, acquire polysomal expression profiles and genetic aberrations typically present in glioma cells rather than normal progenitors, aid progeny cells in glioma initiation upon transplantation, and become independent of PDGFR signaling.

Conclusions/Significance
These results indicate that non-cell-of-origin derived cells within glioma environment in the mouse can be corrupted to become bona fide tumor, and deviate from the generally established view of gliomagenesis.},

Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to understand the global distribution of gene expression levels, and to be able to interpret it mechanistically and functionally. Here we use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse Th2 cells, coupled with a range of other techniques, to show that all genes can be separated, based on their expression abundance, into two distinct groups: one group comprised of lowly expressed and putatively non-functional mRNAs, and the other of highly expressed mRNAs with active chromatin marks at their promoters. These observations are confirmed in many other microarray and RNA-seq data sets of metazoan cell types.},

  abstract = {The existence of a sex difference in Parkinson's disease (PD) is observed as related to several variables, including susceptibility of the disease, age at onset, and symptoms. These differences between men and women represent a significant characteristic of PD, which suggest that estrogens may exert beneficial effects against the development and the progression of the disease. This paper reviews the neuroprotective and neuromodulator effects of 17\ensuremath{\beta}-estradiol and progesterone as compared to androgens in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic (NSDA) system of both female and male rodents. The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice model of PD and methamphetamine toxicity faithfully reproduce the sex differences of PD in that endogenous estrogen levels appear to influence the vulnerability to toxins targeting the NSDA system. Exogenous 17\ensuremath{\beta}-estradiol and/or progesterone treatments show neuroprotective properties against NSDA toxins while androgens fail to induce any beneficial effect. Sex steroid treatments show male and female differences in their neuroprotective action against methamphetamine toxicity. NSDA structure and function, as well as the distribution of estrogen receptors, show sex differences and may influence the susceptibility to the toxins and the response to sex steroids. Genomic and non-genomic actions of 17\ensuremath{\beta}-estradiol converge to promote survival factors and the presence of both estrogen receptors \ensuremath{\alpha} and \ensuremath{\beta} are critical to 17\ensuremath{\beta}-estradiol neuroprotective action against MPTP toxicity.},

Although it is known that striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) are involved in the genesis of this movement disorder, the molecular basis of dyskinesia is not understood. In this study, we identify distinct cell-type\textendash{}specific gene-expression changes that occur in subclasses of SPNs upon induction of a parkinsonian lesion followed by chronic levodopa treatment. We identify several hundred genes, the expression of which is correlated with levodopa dose, many of which are under the control of activator protein-1 and ERK signaling. Despite homeostatic adaptations involving several signaling modulators, activator protein-1\textendash{}dependent gene expression remains highly dysregulated in direct pathway SPNs upon chronic levodopa treatment. We also discuss which molecular pathways are most likely to dampen abnormal dopaminoceptive signaling in spiny projection neurons, hence providing potential targets for antidyskinetic treatments in Parkinson's disease.},

However, the functional  impact of astrocyte reactivity is still unclear.~  During the  last decades, the development of innovative approaches to study  astrocytes has significantly improved our understanding of their  prominent role in brain function and their contribution to disease  states. In particular, new genetic tools, molecular probes, and imaging  techniques that achieve high spatial and temporal resolution have  revealed new insight into astrocyte functions in situ.

This review addresses the concept that sex differences in PD are determined, largely, by biological sex differences in the NSDA system which, in turn, arise from hormonal, genetic and environmental influences. Current therapies for PD rely on dopamine replacement strategies to treat symptoms, and there is an urgent, unmet need for disease modifying agents. As a significant degree of neuroprotection against the early stages of clinical or experimental PD is seen, respectively, in human and rodent females compared with males, a better understanding of brain sex dimorphisms in the intact and injured NSDA system will shed light on mechanisms which have the potential to delay, or even halt, the progression of PD. Available evidence suggests that sex-specific, hormone-based therapeutic agents hold particular promise for developing treatments with optimal efficacy in men and women.},

  abstract = {The neuronal RNA-binding protein HuD plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional regulation of short-lived mRNAs during the initial establishment and remodelling of neural connections. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing this protein (HuD-Tg) in adult DGCs (dentate granule cells) and shown that their mossy fibres contain high levels of GAP-43 (growth-associated protein 43) and exhibit distinct morphological and electrophysiological properties. To investigate the basis for these changes and identify other molecular targets of HuD, DGCs from HuD-Tg and control mice were collected by LCM (laser capture microscopy) and RNAs analysed using DNA microarrays. Results show that 216 known mRNAs transcripts and 63 ESTs (expressed sequence tags) are significantly up-regulated in DGCs from these transgenic mice. Analyses of the 3\ensuremath{'}-UTRs (3\ensuremath{'}-untranslated regions) of these transcripts revealed an increased number of HuD-binding sites and the presence of several known instability\textendash{}conferring sequences. Among these, the mRNA for TTR (transthyretin) shows the highest level of up-regulation, as confirmed by qRT\textendash{}PCR (quantitative reverse transcription\textendash{}PCR) and ISH (in situ hybridization). GO (gene ontology) analyses of up-regulated transcripts revealed a large overrepresentation of genes associated with neural development and axogenesis. In correlation with these gene expression changes, we found an increased length of the infrapyramidal mossy fibre bundle in HuD-Tg mice. These results support the notion that HuD stabilizes a number of developmentally regulated mRNAs in DGCs, resulting in increased axonal elongation.},

  abstract = {The key to treating steroid-induced necrosis of femoral heads (SINFH) is early diagnosis. Dramatic improvements in diagnosis could be made if the pathogenesis of SINFH was more fully understood; however, the underlying mechanism of this disease is currently unknown. To explore the potential mechanism of SINFH, we performed gene array analysis on a rat model of the disease and compare the expression profile with that of normal rats. A quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays were used to confirm the microarray results. Compared to the control group, 190 genes in the experimental group were differentially expressed, with 52 up-regulated and 138 down-regulated. Of these genes, 102 are known (deposited in GenBank), while 88 of them are unknown. The known genes can be divided into several families according to their biological functions, such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, signal transduction, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix, lipid metabolism, and transcription related genes. The results of quantitative RT-PCR and IHC were consistent with gene chip results. Our findings indicate that many genes involved in diverse signaling pathways were differentially expressed between SINFH rats and normal rats. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the development of SINFH is a complicated and dynamic process affected by multiple factors and signaling pathways and regulated by various genes.},

Confirming previously anticipated major neuronal types, our results also classify and provide markers for new, functionally distinct subtypes. For example, our results suggest that itching during inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis is linked to a distinct itch-generating type.

We compared the levels of proteins in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) and tumorigenic HBE cells (1170-I) by high-throughput immunoblotting (PowerBlot Western Array) using 800 monoclonal antibodies. This analysis revealed that 87 proteins increased by \ensuremath{>}2-fold, and 45 proteins decreased by \ensuremath{>}2-fold, in 1170-I compared with NHBE cells. These proteins are involved in DNA synthesis and repair, cell cycle regulation, RNA transcription and degradation, translation, differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell adhesion, cytoskeleton and cell motility, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. Conventional Western blotting using lysates of normal, immortalized, transformed, and tumorigenic HBEs and non\textendash{}small cell lung cancer cell lines confirmed some of these changes. The expression of several of these proteins has been then analyzed by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing 323 samples, including normal bronchial epithelium, hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, dysplasias, squamous cell carcinomas, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, and adenocarcinomas from 144 patients. The results of the immunohistochemical studies correlated with the Western blotting findings and showed gradual increases (caspase-8, signal transducers and activators of transcription 5, and p70s6K) or decrease (E-cadherin) in levels with tumor progression. These results indicate that the changes in proteins detected in this study may occur early in lung carcinogenesis and persist in lung cancer. In addition, some of the proteins detected by this approach may be novel biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer and novel targets for chemoprevention or therapy.

  abstract = {\ensuremath{\beta}-Thalassemia (\ensuremath{\beta}-thal), is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations at the \ensuremath{\beta} gene locus. \ensuremath{\beta}-Thalassemia major (\ensuremath{\beta}-TM) is a severe form of the disease, characterized by severe hypochromic and hemolytic anemia with an increased need for transfusion. Hemolysis is caused by intoxication, whereas mechanical removal of the affected cells caused by macrophage. Immunological implications are also reported and occur via antibodies and complement. We found previously that complement inhibitor receptor CD55 is underexpressed in these patients. This study concerns the compensatory mechanisms of this diminished expression upon flow cytometry analysis of CD55 and CD59 on the red blood cells (RBCs) of \ensuremath{\beta}-thal patients. This study was conducted on 24 patients and 10 healthy controls. Full history and transfusion data was obtained, then a complete blood count (CBC) and flow cytometry analysis of CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes were carried out. Within our 24 patients, we found a diminished expression of CD55 with a normal expression of CD59. The percentage of cells that express CD55 was significantly different from that of the controls. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD55 and CD59 with correlation studies reveals that different factors affect the underexpression of CD55 and also revealed compensatory changes of the defect to minimize the hemolysis occurring in \ensuremath{\beta}-thal patients. Compensation of CD55 underexpression in the deficient patients occurred when an increase in the MFI of both the receptor CD55, on the positive cells, and another complement inhibitor receptor CD59.},

Gender differences in human brain might be related to patterns of gene expression. Microarray technology is one useful method for investigation of gene expression in brain. We investigated gene expression, cell types, and regional expression patterns of differentially expressed sex chromosome genes in brain. We profiled gene expression in male and female dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum using the Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray platform. Differentially expressed genes between males and females on the Y chromosome (DBY, SMCY, UTY, RPS4Y, and USP9Y) and X chromosome (XIST) were confirmed using real-time PCR measurements. In situ hybridization confirmed the differential expression of gender-specific genes and neuronal expression of XIST, RPS4Y, SMCY, and UTY in three brain regions examined. The XIST gene, which silences gene expression on regions of the X chromosome, is expressed in a subset of neurons. Since a subset of neurons express gender-specific genes, neural subpopulations may exhibit a subtle sexual dimorphism at the level of differences in gene regulation and function. The distinctive pattern of neuronal expression of XIST, RPS4Y, SMCY, and UTY and other sex chromosome genes in neuronal subpopulations may possibly contribute to gender differences in prevalence noted for some neuropsychiatric disorders. Studies of the protein expression of these sex-chromosome-linked genes in brain tissue are required to address the functional consequences of the observed gene expression differences.},

To make genome-wide transcriptome data easily accessible, we developed the Glia Open Access Database (GOAD), available via www.goad.education. GOAD contains a collection of previously published and unpublished transcriptome data, including datasets from isolated microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes both at homeostatic and pathological conditions. It contains an intuitive web-based interface that consists of three features that enable searching, browsing, analyzing, and downloading of the data. The first feature is differential gene expression (DE) analysis that provides genes that are significantly up and down-regulated with the associated fold changes and p-values between two conditions of interest. In addition, an interactive Venn diagram is generated to illustrate the overlap and differences between several DE gene lists. The second feature is quantitative gene expression (QE) analysis, to investigate which genes are expressed in a particular glial cell type and to what degree. The third feature is a search utility, which can be used to find a gene of interest and depict its expression in all available expression data sets by generating a gene card. In addition, quality guidelines and relevant concepts for transcriptome analysis are discussed. Finally, GOAD is discussed in relation to several online transcriptome tools developed in neuroscience and immunology. In conclusion, GOAD is a unique platform to facilitate integration of bioinformatics in glia biology. GLIA 2015},

  abstract = {Background
Readily accessible samples such as peripheral blood or cell lines are increasingly being used in large cohorts to characterise gene expression differences between a patient group and healthy controls. However, cell and RNA isolation procedures and the variety of cell types that make up whole blood can affect gene expression measurements. We therefore systematically investigated global gene expression profiles in peripheral blood from six individuals collected during two visits by comparing five of the following cell and RNA isolation methods: whole blood (PAXgene), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), CD19 and CD20 specific B-cell subsets.

Results
Gene expression measurements were clearly discriminated by isolation method although the reproducibility was high for all methods (range \ensuremath{\rho} = 0.90-1.00). The PAXgene samples showed a decrease in the number of expressed genes (P \ensuremath{<} 1*10-16) with higher variability (P \ensuremath{<} 1*10-16) compared to the other methods. Differentially expressed probes between PAXgene and PBMCs were correlated with the number of monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils or erythrocytes. The correlations (\ensuremath{\rho} = 0.83; \ensuremath{\rho} = 0.79) of the expression levels of detected probes between LCLs and B-cell subsets were much lower compared to the two B-cell isolation methods (\ensuremath{\rho} = 0.98). Gene ontology analysis of detected genes showed that genes involved in inflammatory responses are enriched in B-cells CD19 and CD20 whereas genes involved in alcohol metabolic process and the cell cycle were enriched in LCLs.

Conclusion
Gene expression profiles in blood-based samples are strongly dependent on the predominant constituent cell type(s) and RNA isolation method. It is crucial to understand the differences and variability of gene expression measurements between cell and RNA isolation procedures, and their relevance to disease processes, before application in large clinical studies.},

Cortical layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons integrate inputs from many sources and distribute outputs to cortical and subcortical structures. Previous studies demonstrate two L5 pyramid types: cortico-cortical (CC) and cortico-subcortical (CS). We characterize connectivity and function of these cell types in mouse primary visual cortex and reveal a new subtype. Unlike previously described L5 CC and CS neurons, this new subtype does not project to striatum [cortico-cortical, non-striatal (CC-NS)] and has distinct morphology, physiology, and visual responses. Monosynaptic rabies tracing reveals that CC neurons preferentially receive input from higher visual areas, while CS neurons receive more input from structures implicated in top-down modulation of brain states. CS neurons are also more direction-selective and prefer faster stimuli than CC neurons. These differences suggest distinct roles as specialized output channels, with CS neurons integrating information and generating responses more relevant to movement control and CC neurons being more important in visual perception.},

Here we address this issue by using post-mortem adult human brain and spinal cord samples originating from 137 neuropathologically confirmed control individuals to study whole-genome gene expression and splicing in 12 CNS regions. We show that sex differences in gene expression and splicing are widespread in adult human brain, being detectable in all major brain regions and involving 2.5\% of all expressed genes. We give examples of genes where sex-biased expression is both disease-relevant and likely to have functional consequences, and provide evidence suggesting that sex biases in expression may reflect sex-biased gene regulatory structures.},

  abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in regulating neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. Reduced expression of BDNF within the substantia nigra accompanies the deterioration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Analysis of the effects of long-term BDNF absence from the CNS has been difficult because of the early postnatal lethality of BDNF-/- mice. Mice with a floxed BDNF allele were bred with Wnt1-Cre mice to generate Wnt-BDNFKO mice that lack BDNF from the midbrain-hindbrain (MHB). These mice are viable but exhibit hindlimb clutching and poor rotarod performance. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neuron numbers in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) were estimated using stereological methods, revealing a persistent \ensuremath{\sim}23\% reduction of these cells at postnatal day 21 (P21) in Wnt-BDNFKO mice compared with controls. The diminishment of TH-expressing neurons was present at birth and continued through P120. This deficit appears selective for the dopaminergic population, because at P21, total neuron number within the SNC, defined as neuronal nuclei protein-positive cells, was not significantly reduced. Interestingly, and similar to observations in PD patients, SNC neuron subpopulations are not equally affected. Calbindin- and calretinin-expressing SNC populations show no significant difference between Wnt-BDNFKO mice and controls. Thus, BDNF depletion from the MHB selectively leads to reduced TH expression in a subpopulation of neurons, but it remains unclear whether these cells are lost.},

  abstract = {Hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR) induced by the systemic administration of NMDAR antagonists is well known to cause schizophrenia-like symptoms in otherwise healthy subjects. However, the brain areas or cell types responsible for the emergence of these symptoms following NMDAR hypofunction remain largely unknown. One possibility, the so-called ``GABAergic origin hypothesis,'' is that NMDAR hypofunction at GABAergic interneurons, in particular, is sufficient for schizophrenia-like effects. In one attempt to address this issue, transgenic mice were generated in which NMDARs were selectively deleted from cortical and hippocampal GABAergic interneurons, a majority of which were parvalbumin (PV)-positive. This manipulation triggered a constellation of phenotypes\textemdash{}from molecular and physiological to behavioral\textemdash{}resembling characteristics of human schizophrenia. Based on these results, and in conjunction with previous literature, we argue that during development, NMDAR hypofunction at cortical, PV-positive, fast-spiking interneurons produces schizophrenia-like effects. This review summarizes the data demonstrating that in schizophrenia, GABAergic (particularly PV-positive) interneurons are disrupted. PV-positive interneurons, many of which display a fast-spiking firing pattern, are critical not only for tight temporal control of cortical inhibition but also for the generation of synchronous membrane-potential gamma-band oscillations. We therefore suggest that in schizophrenia the specific ability of fast-spiking interneurons to control and synchronize disparate cortical circuits is disrupted and that this disruption may underlie many of the schizophrenia symptoms. We further argue that the high vulnerability of corticolimbic fast-spiking interneurons to genetic predispositions and to early environmental insults\textemdash{}including excitotoxicity and oxidative stress\textemdash{}might help to explain their significant contribution to the development of schizophrenia.},

As a contribution to the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA), we employed immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression pattern of 18 NRs in the cerebellum. Ten receptors were demonstrated to be expressed in the postnatal day 21 (P21) cerebellum. Among them, five receptors (COUP-TFI, COUP-TFII, ROR\ensuremath{\alpha}, ER\ensuremath{\beta}, and ERR\ensuremath{\gamma}) were expressed at all stages (embryonic stage, P0, P7, and P21) examined. Interestingly, COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII show differential anterior-posterior expression patterns during cerebellar development.

  abstract = {The enormous cellular complexity of the brain is a major obstacle for gene expression profiling of neurological disease models, because physiologically relevant changes of transcription in a specific neuronal subset are likely to be lost in the presence of other neurons and glia. We solved this problem in transgenic mice by labeling genetically defined cells with a nuclear variant of GFP. When combined with laser-directed microdissection, intact RNA from unfixed, freeze-dried sections can be isolated, which is a prerequisite for high-quality global transcriptome analysis. Here, we compared gene expression profiles between pyramidal motor neurons and pyramidal somatosensory neurons captured from layer V of the adult neocortex. One striking feature of motor neurons is the elevated expression of ribosomal genes and genes involved in ATP synthesis. This suggests a molecular adaptation of the upper motor neurons to longer axonal projections and higher electrical activity. These molecular signatures were not detected when cortical layers and microareas were analyzed in toto.
Additionally, we used microarrays to determine the global mRNA expression profiles of microdissected Purkinje cells and cellularly complex cerebellar cortex microregions. In summary, our analysis shows that cellularly complex targets lead to averaged gene expression profiles that lack substantial amounts of cell type-specific information. Thus, cell type-restricted sampling strategies are mandatory in the CNS. The combined use of a genetic label with laser-microdissection offers an unbiased approach to map patterns of gene expression onto practically any cell type of the brain.},

  abstract = {Objective: To describe the current treatment; clinical, biochemical, and molecular findings; and clinical follow-up of patients with aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency.
Method: Clinical and biochemical data of 78 patients with AADC deficiency were tabulated in a database of pediatric neurotransmitter disorders (JAKE). A total of 46 patients have been previously reported; 32 patients are described for the first time.
Results: In 96\% of AADC-deficient patients, symptoms (hypotonia 95\%, oculogyric crises 86\%, and developmental retardation 63\%) became clinically evident during infancy or childhood. Laboratory diagnosis is based on typical CSF markers (low homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacidic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenolglycole, and elevated 3-O-methyl-l-dopa, l-dopa, and 5-hydroxytryptophan), absent plasma AADC activity, or elevated urinary vanillactic acid. A total of 24 mutations in the DDC gene were detected in 49 patients (8 reported for the first time: p.L38P, p.Y79C, p.A110Q, p.G123R, p.I42fs, c.876G\ensuremath{>}A, p.R412W, p.I433fs) with IVS6+ 4A\ensuremath{>}T being the most common one (allele frequency 45\%).
Conclusion: Based on clinical symptoms, CSF neurotransmitters profile is highly indicative for the diagnosis of aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Treatment options are limited, in many cases not beneficial, and prognosis is uncertain. Only 15 patients with a relatively mild form clearly improved on a combined therapy with pyridoxine (B6)/pyridoxal phosphate, dopamine agonists, and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.},

  abstract = {Organized neuronal firing is critical for cortical processing and is disrupted in schizophrenia. Using 5' RACE in human brain, we identified a primate-specific isoform (3.1) of the K+-channel KCNH2 that modulates neuronal firing. KCNH2-3.1 mRNA levels are comparable to KCNH2-1A in brain, but 1000-fold lower in heart. In schizophrenic hippocampus, KCNH2-3.1 expression is 2.5-fold greater than KCNH2-1A. A meta-analysis of 5 clinical samples (367 families, 1158 unrelated cases, 1704 controls) shows association of SNPs in KCNH2 with schizophrenia. Risk-associated alleles predict lower IQ scores and speed of cognitive processing, altered memory-linked fMRI signals, and increased KCNH2-3.1 expression in post-mortem hippocampus. KCNH2-3.1 lacks a domain critical for slow channel deactivation. Overexpression of KCNH2-3.1 in primary cortical neurons induces a rapidly deactivating K+ current and a high-frequency, non-adapting firing pattern. These results identify a novel KCNH2 channel involved in cortical physiology, cognition, and psychosis, providing a potential new psychotherapeutic drug target.},

  abstract = {Tracking serotonergic pathways in the brain through immunodetection of serotonin has widely been used for the anatomical characterization of the serotonergic system. Immunostaining for serotonin is also frequently applied for the visualization of individual serotonin containing fibers and quantification of serotonin positive fibers has been widely used to detect changes in the serotonergic innervation. However, particularly in conditions with enhanced serotonin metabolism the detection level of serotonin may lead to an underestimation of the true number of serotonergic fibers. The serotonin transporter (SERT) protein, on the other hand, is less liable to metabolism and for that reason we hypothetized that SERT immunostaining is a more stable marker of serotonergic fibers. Rats were pretreated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor and compared with placebo treated rats. Brains were double immunostained for serotonin and SERT protein and colocalization was quantified in several brain areas by confocal microscopy. In comparison with untreated rats, MAO inhibitor treated rats had a significantly higher number (almost 200\% increase) of serotonin immunopositive fibers whereas no difference was observed in the number of the SERT positive fibers. Colocalization between serotonin and SERT positive fibers was close to 100\% in MAO inhibitor treated animals but only 30\% in untreated rats. We conclude that the rapid metabolism of serotonin leads to an underestimation of immunodetected serotonergic fibers and that in many instances, SERT immunostaining may be a better indicator of serotonergic fibers.

More than 10,000 articles have been published during this time. Important new research avenues of clinical importance have opened up such as the role of microglia in pain and in brain tumors. New controversies have also emerged such as the question of whether microglia are active or reactive players in neurodegenerative disease conditions, or whether they may be victims themselves. Premature commercial interests may be responsible for some of the confusion that currently surrounds microglia in both the Alzheimer and Parkinson's disease research fields. A critical review of the literature shows that the concept of "(micro)glial inflammation" is still open to interpretation, despite a prevailing slant towards a negative meaning. Perhaps the most exciting foreseeable development concerns research on the role of microglia in synaptic plasticity, which is expected to yield an answer to the question whether microglia are the brain's electricians. This review provides an analysis of the latest developments in the microglia field.},

We have previously reported that monocytes from patients with B-cell NHL have an immunosuppressive CD14+HLA-DRlow/- phenotype that correlates with a poor prognosis. However, the underlying mechanism by which CD14+HLA-DRlow/- monocytes develop in lymphoma is unknown. In the present study, we found that interleukin (IL)-10, which is increased in the serum of patients with B-cell NHL, induced the development of the CD4+HLA-DRlow/- population. Using peripheral blood samples from patients with B-cell NHL, we found that absolute numbers of CD14+ monocytic cells with an HLA-DRlow/- phenotype were higher than healthy controls and correlated with a higher International Prognostic Index score. IL-10 serum levels were elevated in lymphoma patients compared with controls and were associated with increased peripheral monocyte counts. Treatment of monocytes with IL-10 in vitro significantly decreased HLA-DR expression and resulted in the expansion of CD14+HLA-DRlow/- population. We found that lymphoma B cells produce IL-10 and supernatants from cultured lymphoma cells increased the CD14+HLA-DRlow/- population. Furthermore, we found that IL-10-induced CD14+HLA-DRlow/- monocytes inhibited the activation and proliferation of T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that elevated IL-10 serum levels contribute to increased numbers of immunosuppressive CD14+HLA-DRlow/- monocytes in B-cell NHL.},

  abstract = {The molecular basis of schizophrenia is poorly understood; however, different brain regions are believed to play distinct roles in disease symptomology. We have studied gene expression in the superior temporal cortex (Brodmann area 22; BA22), which may play a role in positive pathophysiology, and compared our results with data from the anterior prefrontal cortex (BA10), which shows evidence for a role in negative symptoms. Genome-wide mRNA expression was determined in the BA22 region in 23 schizophrenics and 19 controls and compared with a BA10 data set from the same subjects. After adjustments for confounding sources of variation, we carried out GeneGO pathway enrichment analysis in each region. Significant differences were seen in age-related transcriptional changes between the BA22 and the BA10 regions, 21.8\% and 41.4\% of disease-associated transcripts showing age association, respectively. After removing age associated changes from our data, we saw the highest enrichment in processes mediating cell adhesion, synaptic contact, cytoskeletal remodelling, and apoptosis in the BA22 region. For the BA10 region, we observed the strongest changes in reproductive signalling, tissue remodelling, and cell differentiation. Further exploratory analysis also identified potentially disease-relevant processes that were undetected in our more stringent primary analysis, including autophagy in the BA22 region and the amyloid process in the BA10 region. Collectively, our analysis suggests disruption of many common pathways and processes underpinning synaptic plasticity in both regions in schizophrenia, whereas individual regions emphasize changes in certain pathways that may help to highlight pathway-specific therapeutic opportunities to treat negative or positive symptoms of the disease. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT), an important modulator of both sensory and motor functions in the mammalian spinal cord, originates mainly in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem. However, following complete transection of the spinal cord, small amounts of 5-HT remain detectable below the lesion. It has been suggested, but not proven, that this residual 5-HT is produced by intraspinal 5-HT neurons. Here, we show by immunohistochemical techniques that cells containing the enzyme aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) occur not only near the central canal, as reported by others, but also in the intermediate zone and dorsal horn of the spinal gray matter. We show that, following complete transection of the rat spinal cord at S2 level, AADC cells distal to the lesion acquire the ability to produce 5-HT from its immediate precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan. Our results indicate that this phenotypic change in spinal AADC cells is initiated by the loss of descending 5-HT projections due to spinal cord injury (SCI). By in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, we show that 5-HT produced by AADC cells increases the excitability of spinal motoneurons. The phenotypic change in AADC cells appears to result from a loss of inhibition by descending 5-HT neurons and to be mediated by 5-HT1B receptors expressed by AADC cells. These findings indicate that AADC cells are a potential source of 5-HT at spinal levels below an SCI. The production of 5-HT by AADC cells, together with an upregulation of 5-HT2 receptors, offers a partial explanation of hyperreflexia below a chronic SCI.},

We found that microRNA-128 (miR-128), which is expressed in adult neurons, regulates motor behavior by modulating neuronal signaling networks and excitability. miR-128 governs motor activity by suppressing the expression of various ion channels and signaling components of the extracellular signal\textendash{}regulated kinase ERK2 network that regulate neuronal excitability. In mice, a reduction of miR-128 expression in postnatal neurons causes increased motor activity and fatal epilepsy. Overexpression of miR-128 attenuates neuronal responsiveness, suppresses motor activity, and alleviates motor abnormalities associated with Parkinson's\textendash{}like disease and seizures in mice. These data suggest a therapeutic potential for miR-128 in the treatment of epilepsy and movement disorders.

The microRNA miR128 is expressed in brain neurons of the mouse. Lek Tan et al. (p. 1254) now find that miR128 is crucial to stable brain function. Mice deficient in miR128 developed hyperactivity and were susceptible to fatal seizures, whereas overexpression of miR128 correlated with reduced motor activity and reduced susceptibility to proconvulsive drugs. Experiments using ex vivo\textendash{}isolated adult brain tissues suggested that miR-128 controlled motor activity by governing the signaling network that determines the intrinsic excitability and signal responsiveness of neurons.},

However, how nicotinic modulation impacts specific subpopulations of diverse GABAergic interneurons remains in question. One potential way of conferring specificity to the convergence of GABAergic and nicotinic signaling is through the expression of a unique family of nicotinic acetycholine receptor modulators, the Lynx family.

  abstract = {Background. The majority of patients with tuberculosis who comply with appropriate treatment are cured. However, \ensuremath{\sim}5\% subsequently have a repeat disease episode, usually within 2 years of successful combination therapy. Presently, there is no way of predicting which patients will experience a relapse.
Methods. We identified 10 subjects who had previously experienced recurrent tuberculosis and carefully matched them to cured subjects who had had only 1 episode of tuberculosis, to patients with active tuberculosis, and to latently infected healthy subjects. We compared their ex vivo whole-blood gene-expression profiles by use of DNA array technology and confirmed the results by use of quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
Results. The 4 clinical tuberculosis groups exhibited distinct patterns of gene expression. The gene-transcript profiles of the patients with recurrent tuberculosis were more similar to those of the patients with active tuberculosis than to those of the cured or latently infected subjects. Discriminant analysis of a training data set showed that 9 genes were sufficient to classify the subjects. We confirmed that measurement of the expression of these genes by qRT-PCR can accurately discriminate between subjects in a test set of samples.
Conclusions. A simple test based on gene-expression patterns may be used as a biomarker of cure while identifying patients who are at risk for relapse. This would facilitate the introduction of new tuberculosis drugs.},

Besides saltatory conduction, the myelin sheath also protects axons against inflammatory and oxidative insults, and loss of myelin results in axonal damage and ultimately neuronal loss in demyelinating disorders. However, accumulating evidence indicates that OLs also provide support to neurons via mechanisms beyond the insulating function of myelin. More importantly, an increasing volume of reports indicates defects of OLs in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, sometimes even preceding neuronal loss in pre-symptomatic episodes, suggesting that OL pathology may be an important mechanism contributing to the initiation and/or progression of neurodegeneration. This review focuses on the emerging picture of neuronal support by OLs in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders through diverse molecular and cellular mechanisms, including direct neuron-myelin interaction, metabolic support by OLs, and neurotrophic factors produced by and/or acting on OLs.},

Introduction of 10(8) pfu of these viruses into the adult rat cerebellum by stereotactic injection yielded neural cell-type-specific expression without apparent toxicity to the animals.

RNA was analyzed in blood from six CRPC patients by whole-transcriptome sequencing (total RNA-sequencing) before and after docetaxel treatment using the Illumina's HiSeq platform. Targeted RNA capture and sequencing was performed in an independent cohort of ten patients with CRPC matching the discovery cohort to confirm differential expression of the genes. Response to docetaxel was defined on the basis of prostate-specific antigen levels and imaging criteria. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare differential gene expression in patients classified as responders versus nonresponders before and after docetaxel treatment. Thirty-four genes with two-fold differentially expressed transcripts in responders versus nonresponders were selected from total RNA-sequencing for further validation. Targeted RNA capture and sequencing showed that 13/34 genes were differentially expressed in responders. Alpha defensin genes DEFA1, DEFA1B, and DEFA3 exhibited significantly higher expression in responder patients compared with nonresponder patients before administration of chemotherapy (fold change \ensuremath{>}2.5). In addition, post-docetaxel treatment significantly increased transcript levels of these defensin genes in responders (fold change \ensuremath{>}2.8). Our results reveal that patients with higher defensin RNA transcripts in blood respond well to docetaxel therapy. We suggest that monitoring DEFA1, DEFA1B, and DEFA3 RNA transcripts in blood prior to treatment will be helpful to determine which patients are better candidates to receive docetaxel chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {The chronic high-level alcohol consumption seen in alcoholism leads to dramatic effects on the hippocampus, including decreased white matter, loss of oligodendrocytes and other glial cells, and inhibition of neurogenesis. Examining gene expression in post mortem hippocampal tissue from 20 alcoholics and 19 controls allowed us to detect differentially expressed genes that may play a role in the risk for alcoholism or whose expression is modified by chronic consumption of alcohol. We identified 639 named genes whose expression significantly differed between alcoholics and controls at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) \ensuremath{\leq} 0.20; 52\% of these genes differed by at least 1.2-fold. Differentially expressed genes included the glucocorticoid receptor and the related gene FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5), UDP glycosyltransferase 8 (UGT8), urea transporter (SLC14A1), zinc transporter (SLC39A10), Interleukin 1 receptor type 1 (IL1R1), thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), and many metallothioneins. Pathways related to inflammation, hypoxia, and stress showed activation, and pathways that play roles in neurogenesis and myelination showed decreases. The cortisol pathway dysregulation and increased inflammation identified here are seen in other stress-related conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and most likely play a role in addiction. Many of the detrimental effects on the hippocampus appear to be mediated through NF-\ensuremath{\kappa}B signaling. Twenty-four of the differentially regulated genes were previously identified by genome-wide association studies of alcohol use disorders; this raises the potential interest of genes not normally associated with alcoholism, such as suppression of tumorigenicity 18 (ST18), BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), and von Willebrand factor (VWF).},

To characterize innate physiological differences between A9 and A10 DA neurons, we determined gene expression profiles in these neurons in the adult mouse by laser capture microdissection, microarray analysis and real-time PCR. We found 42 genes relatively elevated in A9 DA neurons, whereas 61 genes were elevated in A10 DA neurons [\ensuremath{>}2-fold; false discovery rate (FDR) \ensuremath{<}1\%]. Genes of interest for further functional analysis were selected by criteria of (i) fold differences in gene expression, (ii) real-time PCR validation and (iii) potential roles in neurotoxic or protective biochemical pathways. Three A9-elevated molecules [G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying K channel 2 (GIRK2), adenine nucleotide translocator 2 (ANT-2) and the growth factor IGF-1] and three A10-elevated peptides (GRP, CGRP and PACAP) were further examined in both \ensuremath{\alpha}-synuclein overexpressing PC12 (PC12-\ensuremath{\alpha}Syn) cells and rat primary ventral mesencephalic (VM) cultures exposed to MPP+ neurotoxicity. GIRK2-positive DA neurons were more vulnerable to MPP+ toxicity and overexpression of GIRK2 increased the vulnerability of PC12-\ensuremath{\alpha}Syn cells to the toxin. Blocking of ANT decreased vulnerability to MPP+ in both cell culture systems. Exposing cells to IGF-1, GRP and PACAP decreased vulnerability of both cell types to MPP+, whereas CGRP protected PC12-\ensuremath{\alpha}Syn cells but not primary VM DA neurons. These results indicate that certain differentially expressed molecules in A9 and A10 DA neurons may play key roles in their relative vulnerability to toxins and PD.},

  abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

Leveraging knowledge from neurobiology may help parse the genetic complexity: identifying genes important for a circuit that mediates a particular symptom of a disease may help identify polymorphisms that contribute to risk for the disease as a whole. The serotonergic system has long been suspected in disorders that have symptoms of repetitive behaviors and resistance to change, including autism. We generated a bacTRAP mouse line to permit translational profiling of serotonergic neurons. From this, we identified several thousand serotonergic-cell expressed transcripts, of which 174 were highly enriched, including all known markers of these cells. Analysis of common variants near the corresponding genes in the AGRE collection implicated the RNA binding protein CELF6 in autism risk. Screening for rare variants in CELF6 identified an inherited premature stop codon in one of the probands. Subsequent disruption of Celf6 in mice resulted in animals exhibiting resistance to change and decreased ultrasonic vocalization as well as abnormal levels of serotonin in the brain. This work provides a reproducible and accurate method to profile serotonergic neurons under a variety of conditions and suggests a novel paradigm for gaining information on the etiology of psychiatric disorders.},

Comparably reductionist experiments are neither technically nor ethically possible in humans. However, there is growing concern that laboratory mice do not reflect relevant aspects of the human immune system, which may account for failures to translate disease treatments from bench to bedside. Laboratory mice live in abnormally hygienic specific pathogen free (SPF) barrier facilities. Here we show that standard laboratory mouse husbandry has profound effects on the immune system and that environmental changes produce mice with immune systems closer to those of adult humans. Laboratory mice\textemdash{}like newborn, but not adult, humans\textemdash{}lack effector-differentiated and mucosally distributed memory T cells. These cell populations were present in free-living barn populations of feral mice and pet store mice with diverse microbial experience, and were induced in laboratory mice after co-housing with pet store mice, suggesting that the environment is involved in the induction of these cells. Altering the living conditions of mice profoundly affected the cellular composition of the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulted in global changes in blood cell gene expression to patterns that more closely reflected the immune signatures of adult humans rather than neonates, altered resistance to infection, and influenced T-cell differentiation in response to a de novo viral infection. These data highlight the effects of environment on the basal immune state and response to infection and suggest that restoring physiological microbial exposure in laboratory mice could provide a relevant tool for modelling immunological events in free-living organisms, including humans.},

  issn = {2162-3279},
  doi = {10.1002/brb3.163},
  abstract = {Background
Recent evidence indicates that hypothalamic neurons acquire or lose the capacity to synthesize and release dopamine (DA) in response to environmental stimuli, and this has functional and behavioral consequences for adult rats. We have evidence that neuronal activity, including that driven by afferent input, regulates acquisition and loss of the DA phenotype by substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons in adult mice., Hypotheses The aims of the present study were to determine whether the environment or behavior regulates the number of SNc DA neurons in adult mice, and whether this is mediated by afferent input.

Methods
Adult mice were subject to two different environments/behaviors: ``mating'' for 1 week or ``environment enrichment'' (EE) for 2 weeks; then the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the rate limiting enzyme in DA synthesis) immunopositive (TH+) and immunonegative (TH-) SNc neurons were counted.

Results
More TH+ neurons were present in mated males whereas less TH+ neurons were present in mated females. Also, more TH+ neurons were present in EE males, and this increase was completely abolished by concurrent local infusion of GABAA receptor antagonists.

Conclusions
The number of DA neurons in the adult SNc is not fixed, but readily increases and decreases in response to environmental stimuli and/or behaviors. These changes are mediated by afferent input relaying information about the environment or behavior to SNc neurons.},

  abstract = {Brain development and function depend on the precise regulation of gene expression. However, our understanding of the complexity and dynamics of the transcriptome of the human brain is incomplete. Here we report the generation and analysis of exon-level transcriptome and associated genotyping data, representing males and females of different ethnicities, from multiple brain regions and neocortical areas of developing and adult post-mortem human brains. We found that 86 per cent of the genes analysed were expressed, and that 90 per cent of these were differentially regulated at the whole-transcript or exon level across brain regions and/or time. The majority of these spatio-temporal differences were detected before birth, with subsequent increases in the similarity among regional transcriptomes. The transcriptome is organized into distinct co-expression networks, and shows sex-biased gene expression and exon usage. We also profiled trajectories of genes associated with neurobiological categories and diseases, and identified associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression. This study provides a comprehensive data set on the human brain transcriptome and insights into the transcriptional foundations of human neurodevelopment.},

The same intersection, when preceded by a third signal, FGF4, which is expressed in the primitive streak, defines an inductive center for hindbrain 5-HT neurons. These findings illustrate that cell patterning in the neural plate is a multistep process in which early inducers, which initially divide the neural plate into crude compartments, are replaced by multiple local organizing centers, which specify distinct neuronal cell types within these compartments.},

The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease neurodegeneration have not been fully determined. Clinical investigations and subacute in vivo studies using the neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine have generated some observations suggesting that apoptosis is involved in neurodegeneration; however, this view remains equivocal. In this study, the substantia nigra pars compacta neurodegenerative process was examined in the chronic mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid model of Parkinson's disease treated with 10 doses of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (25 mg/kg) and probenecid (250 mg/kg) over five weeks. One day after chronic treatment, numerous terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells were detected specifically in the substantia nigra pars compacta displaying shrunken volume, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation. The number of apoptotic cells declined over time. No terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells were found in untreated or probenecid-treated control animals. Cytomorphometric analysis of substantia nigra pars compacta nuclear loci revealed eccentric nucleoli dislocation and vesicular degranulation in all of the apoptotic neurons for the mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid model for Parkinson's disease. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells phenotypically showed neuronal origin (NeuN-positive) with a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity. While the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells were not co-localized with astroglial (GFAP-positive) cells, some apoptotic cells were clearly associated with the activated microglial (macrophage antigen complex-1 and isolectin B4-positive) cells suggesting an active process of dead cell removal. In the one-day and seven-day post-treated mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid model for Parkinson's disease, marked depression of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum was observed, which was correlated with significant reductions of striatal dopamine content and uptake. These results suggest that initial neuronal apoptosis and morphological changes are involved, at least in part, in the chronic neurodegeneration of mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid model for Parkinson's disease.},

Although dopamine is known to influence the motor or cognitive functions mediated by other brain regions and to play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the cerebellum has not been thought to be a target of dopamine-containing axons. However, given recent reports of dopamine receptors in the cerebellum, we sought to determine whether axons immunoreactive for the proteins involved in dopamine synthesis and reuptake are present in the cerebellum of macaque monkeys. We found that axons immunoreactive for the dopamine membrane transporter, a specific marker of dopamine axons, were present in high density, but only in certain lobules of the cerebellar vermis. In addition, these axons were found principally in the granule cell layer, where they densely arborized immediately subjacent to the Purkinje cells. Similarly, axons labeled for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, were also present in high density in the granule cell layer of the same lobules of the vermis. In contrast, axons immunoreactive for dopamine beta-hydroxylase, a marker of noradrenergic axons, exhibited a different and more widespread pattern of innervation. These findings are consistent with a dopamine innervation of the primate cerebellum that is both lobular- and laminar-specific, and they suggest that dopamine may play a role in certain cerebellar functions.},

  abstract = {An important goal in neuroscience is to understand gene expression patterns in the brain. The recent availability of comprehensive and detailed expression atlases for mouse and human creates opportunities to discover global patterns and perform cross-species comparisons. Recently we reported that the major source of variation in gene transcript expression in the adult normal mouse brain can be parsimoniously explained as reflecting regional variation in glia to neuron ratios, and is correlated with degree of connectivity and location in the brain along the anterior-posterior axis. Here we extend this investigation to two gene expression assays of adult normal human brains that consisted of over 300 brain region samples, and perform comparative analyses of brain-wide expression patterns to the mouse. We performed principal components analysis (PCA) on the regional gene expression of the adult human brain to identify the expression pattern that has the largest variance. As in the mouse, we observed that the first principal component is composed of two anti-correlated patterns enriched in oligodendrocyte and neuron markers respectively. However, we also observed interesting discordant patterns between the two species. For example, a few mouse neuron markers show expression patterns that are more correlated with the human oligodendrocyte-enriched pattern and vice-versa. In conclusion, our work provides insights into human brain function and evolution by probing global relationships between regional cell type marker expression patterns in the human and mouse brain.},

Despite the widespread importance of the central serotonergic neurotransmitter system, little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling the development of 5-HT neurons. We previously identified an ETS domain transcription factor, Pet-1, that is expressed in a small number of tissues, including the brain. Here, we show that expression of Pet-1 RNA in the brain is restricted to, and marks, the entire rostrocaudal extent of rat serotonergic hindbrain raphe nuclei. Remarkably, Pet-1 RNA colocalizes with tryptophan hydroxylase-positive neurons in raphe nuclei but not with their nonserotonergic neuron or non-neuronal neighbors. Pet-1 RNA is limited to two domains in the developing hindbrain, which precedes the appearance of 5-HT in each domain by approximately a half day. Conserved Pet-1 binding sites are present in or near the promoter regions of the human and mouse 5-HT1a receptor, serotonin transporter, tryptophan hydroxylase, and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase genes whose expression is characteristic of the serotonergic neuron phenotype. These sites are capable of supporting transcriptional activation through interactions with the Pet-1 ETS domain and can function as enhancers. Together, our findings establish Pet-1 as an early and precise marker of 5-HT neurons and suggest that it functions specifically in the differentiation and maintenance of these neurons.},

Selective neuronal loss is the hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), most motor neurons die but those innervating extraocular, pelvic sphincter, and slow limb muscles exhibit selective resistance. We identified 18 genes that show \&gt;10-fold differential expression between resistant and vulnerable motor neurons. One of these, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), is expressed only by fast motor neurons, which are selectively vulnerable. In ALS model mice expressing mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1), reduction of MMP-9 function using gene ablation, viral gene therapy, or pharmacological inhibition significantly delayed muscle denervation. In the presence of mutant SOD1, MMP-9 expressed by fast motor neurons themselves enhances activation of ER stress and is sufficient to trigger axonal die-back. These findings define MMP-9 as a candidate therapeutic target for ALS. The molecular basis of neuronal diversity thus provides significant insights into mechanisms of selective vulnerability to neurodegeneration.},

To simplify this task, all developmental control genes relevant to the cerebellum have been grouped into four categories based on 13 spontaneous mouse mutations with cerebellar developmental defects and for which the aberrant gene has been identified. These categories include genetic switch genes and genes for morphogenesis, physiology, and metabolism. Three distinct gene targetome studies are discussed in order to introduce some signature networks of major importance to cerebellum development based on the genetic switches En2, Atoh1 (Math1), and Rora (ROR\ensuremath{\alpha}). Similarly, array approaches have begun to reveal gene expression changes due to mutations in physiology and metabolism genes, such as Kcnj6 (Girk2) and Agtpbp1 (Nna1), respectively. These studies are revealing the interplay between transcription, morphogenetic factors, physiology, and metabolism during development. Lastly, genomics and informatics approaches are uncovering new markers of all cerebellar cell types at all stages that will be useful in the future for further clarifying the complex and often reciprocal nature of developmental mechanisms in the nervous system.},

  abstract = {The mechanism that causes neural stem cells in the central nervous system to switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis is poorly understood. Here we analyzed spinal cord development of mice in which the transcription factor Sox9 was specifically ablated from neural stem cells by the CRE/loxP recombination system. These mice exhibit defects in the specification of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, the two main types of glial cells in the central nervous system. Accompanying an early dramatic reduction in progenitors of the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, there was a transient increase in motoneurons. Oligodendrocyte progenitor numbers recovered at later stages of development, probably owing to compensatory actions of the related Sox10 and Sox8, both of which overlap with Sox9 in the oligodendrocyte lineage. In agreement, compound loss of Sox9 and Sox10 led to a further decrease in oligodendrocyte progenitors. Astrocyte numbers were also severely reduced in the absence of Sox9 and did not recover at later stages of spinal cord development. Taking the common origin of motoneurons and oligodendrocytes as well as V2 interneurons and some astrocytes into account, stem cells apparently fail to switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in at least two domains of the ventricular zone, indicating that Sox9 is a major molecular component of the neuron\textendash{}glia switch in the developing spinal cord.},

  abstract = {Astrocytes are specialized glial cells that outnumber neurons by over fivefold. They contiguously tile the entire central nervous system (CNS) and exert many essential complex functions in the healthy CNS. Astrocytes respond to all forms of CNS insults through a process referred to as reactive astrogliosis, which has become a pathological hallmark of CNS structural lesions. Substantial progress has been made recently in determining functions and mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis and in identifying roles of astrocytes in CNS disorders and pathologies. A vast molecular arsenal at the disposal of reactive astrocytes is being defined. Transgenic mouse models are dissecting specific aspects of reactive astrocytosis and glial scar formation in vivo. Astrocyte involvement in specific clinicopathological entities is being defined. It is now clear that reactive astrogliosis is not a simple all-or-none phenomenon but is a finely gradated continuum of changes that occur in context-dependent manners regulated by specific signaling events. These changes range from reversible alterations in gene expression and cell hypertrophy with preservation of cellular domains and tissue structure, to long-lasting scar formation with rearrangement of tissue structure. Increasing evidence points towards the potential of reactive astrogliosis to play either primary or contributing roles in CNS disorders via loss of normal astrocyte functions or gain of abnormal effects. This article reviews (1) astrocyte functions in healthy CNS, (2) mechanisms and functions of reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation, and (3) ways in which reactive astrocytes may cause or contribute to specific CNS disorders and lesions.},

A9 neurons form the nigrostriatal pathway and are involved in regulating voluntary movements and postural reflexes. Their selective degeneration leads to Parkinson's disease. Here, we report that gene expression analysis of A9 dopaminergic neurons (DA) identifies transcripts for \ensuremath{\alpha}- and \ensuremath{\beta}-chains of hemoglobin (Hb). Globin immunoreactivity decorates the majority of A9 DA, a subpopulation of cortical and hippocampal astrocytes and mature oligodendrocytes. This pattern of expression was confirmed in different mouse strains and in rat and human. We show that Hb is expressed in the SN of human postmortem brain. By microarray analysis of dopaminergic cell lines overexpressing \ensuremath{\alpha}- and \ensuremath{\beta}-globin chains, changes in genes involved in O2 homeostasis and oxidative phopshorylation were observed, linking Hb expression to mitochondrial function. Our data suggest that the most famed oxygen-carrying globin is not exclusively restricted to the blood, but it may play a role in the normal physiology of the brain and neurodegenerative diseases.},

Various members of the sirtuin class have been found to be involved in processes related to longevity, regulation of inflammation, and neuroprotection. Induction of Sirt2 mRNA was found in the whole hemisphere after experimental stroke in a recent screening approach. Moreover, Sirt2 protein is highly expressed in myelin-rich brain regions after stroke. To examine the effects of Sirt2 on ischemic stroke, we induced transient focal cerebral ischemia in adult male Sirt2-knockout and wild-type mice. Two stroke models with different occlusion times were applied: a severe ischemia (45 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)) and a mild one (15 minutes of MCAO), which was used to focus on subcortical infarcts. Neurological deficit was determined at 48 hours after 45 minutes of MCAO, and up to 7 days after induction of 15 minutes of cerebral ischemia. In contrast to recent data on Sirt1, Sirt2-/- mice showed less neurological deficits in both models of experimental stroke, with the strongest manifestation after 48 hours of reperfusion. However, we did not observe a significant difference of stroke volumes or inflammatory cell count between Sirt2-deficient and wild-type mice. Thus we postulate that Sirt2 mediates myelin-dependent neuronal dysfunction during the early phase after ischemic stroke.},

Further, this exquisite control of gene expression is perturbed in many diseases. As a consequence, coordinated physiological responses to the environment are compromised. Recently, innovative tools have been developed that are able to capture genome-wide gene expression using cell-type-specific approaches. These novel techniques allow us to understand gene regulation in~vivo with unprecedented resolution and give us mechanistic insights into how multicellular organisms adapt to changing environments.

Characterization of the variation in gene expression in healthy tissue is an essential foundation for the recognition and interpretation of the changes in these patterns associated with infections and other diseases, and peripheral blood was selected because it is a uniquely accessible tissue in which to examine this variation in patients or healthy volunteers in a clinical setting. Specific features of interindividual variation in gene expression patterns in peripheral blood could be traced to variation in the relative proportions of specific blood cell subsets; other features were correlated with gender, age, and the time of day at which the sample was taken. An analysis of multiple sequential samples from the same individuals allowed us to discern donor-specific patterns of gene expression.

  abstract = {Motivation: Identifying alterations in gene expression associated with different clinical states is important for the study of human biology. However, clinical samples used in gene expression studies are often derived from heterogeneous mixtures with variable cell-type composition, complicating statistical analysis. Considerable effort has been devoted to modeling sample heterogeneity, and presently there are many methods that can estimate cell proportions or pure cell- type expression from mixture data. However, there is no method that comprehensively addresses mixture analysis in the context of differential expression without relying on additional proportion information, which can be inaccurate and is frequently unavailable.
Results: In this study we consider a clinically relevant situation where neither accurate proportion estimates nor pure cell expression is of direct interest, but where we are rather interested in detecting and interpreting relevant differential expression in mixture samples. We develop a method, cell-type COmputational Differential Estimation (CellCODE), that addresses the specific statistical question directly, without requiring a physical model for mixture components. Our approach is based on latent variable analysis and is computationally transparent, requires no additional experimental data, yet outperforms existing methods that use independent proportion measurements. CellCODE has few parameters that are robust and easy to interpret. The method can be used to track changes in proportion, improve power to detect differential expression and assign the differentially expressed genes to the correct cell-type.

Although the antiviral effects of IFNs are well characterized, their immunomodulatory properties are less clear. To specifically address the effects of type I IFNs on T regulatory cells (Tregs), we studied mixed bone marrow chimeras between wild-type and IFN-\ensuremath{\alpha}/\ensuremath{\beta} receptor (IFNAR) knockout (KO) mice, and heterozygous female mice expressing a Treg-specific deletion of the IFNAR. In these two models, IFNAR signaling promotes the development of the Treg lineage in the thymus and their survival in the periphery. IFNAR KO Tregs had a higher expression of the proapoptotic gene Bim and higher frequency of active caspase-positive cells. IFNAR KO Tregs from chimeric mice displayed a more naive phenotype, accompanied by lower levels of CD25 and phosphorylated STAT5. Therefore, in Tregs, IFNAR signaling may directly or indirectly affect phosphorylation of STAT5. In mixed chimeras with Scurfy fetal liver, Tregs derived from IFNAR KO bone marrow were unable to control T effector cell activation and tissue inflammation. Under stress conditions or in a competitive environment, IFNAR signaling may be required to maintain Treg homeostasis and function.},

MeCP2 is believed to be required for proper regulation of brain gene expression, but prior microarray studies in Mecp2 knock-out mice using brain tissue homogenates have revealed only subtle changes in gene expression (Tudor et al., 2002; Nuber et al., 2005; Jordan et al., 2007; Chahrour et al., 2008). Here, by profiling discrete subtypes of neurons we uncovered more dramatic effects of MeCP2 on gene expression, overcoming the ``dilution problem'' associated with assaying homogenates of complex tissues. The results reveal misregulation of genes involved in neuronal connectivity and communication. Importantly, genes upregulated following loss of MeCP2 are biased toward longer genes but this is not true for downregulated genes, suggesting MeCP2 may selectively repress long genes. Because genes involved in neuronal connectivity and communication, such as cell adhesion and cell\textendash{}cell signaling genes, are enriched among longer genes, their misregulation following loss of MeCP2 suggests a possible etiology for altered circuit function in Rett syndrome.},

  abstract = {The assembly of neural circuits involves multiple sequential steps such as the specification of cell-types, their migration to proper brain locations, morphological and physiological differentiation, and the formation and maturation of synaptic connections. This intricate and often prolonged process is guided by elaborate genetic mechanisms that regulate each step. Evidence from numerous systems suggests that each cell-type, once specified, is endowed with a genetic program that unfolds in response to, and is regulated by, extrinsic signals, including cell\textendash{}cell and synaptic interactions. To a large extent, the execution of this intrinsic program is achieved by the expression of specific sets of genes that support distinct developmental processes. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the developmental progression of gene expression in synaptic partners of neurons may provide a basis for exploring the genetic mechanisms regulating circuit assembly. Here we examined the developmental gene expression profiles of well-defined cell-types in a stereotyped microcircuit of the cerebellar cortex. We found that the transcriptomes of Purkinje cell and stellate/basket cells are highly dynamic throughout postnatal development. We revealed ``phasic expression'' of transcription factors, ion channels, receptors, cell adhesion molecules, gap junction proteins, and identified distinct molecular pathways that might contribute to sequential steps of cerebellar inhibitory circuit formation. We further revealed a correlation between genomic clustering and developmental co-expression of hundreds of transcripts, suggesting the involvement of chromatin level gene regulation during circuit formation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To optimise a strategy for identifying gene expression signatures differentiating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis that provide insight into disease pathogenesis and identify biomarkers.
METHODS: 44 vasculitis patients, 13 SLE patients and 25 age and sex-matched controls were enrolled. CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, monocytes and neutrophils were isolated from each patient and, together with unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), were hybridised to spotted oligonucleotide microarrays.
RESULTS: Using expression data obtained from purified cells a substantial number of differentially expressed genes were identified that were not detectable in the analysis of PBMC. Analysis of purified T cells identified a SLE-associated, CD4 T-cell signature consistent with type 1 interferon signalling driving the generation and survival of tissue homing T cells and thereby contributing to disease pathogenesis. Moreover, hierarchical clustering using expression data from purified monocytes provided significantly improved discrimination between the patient groups than that obtained using PBMC data, presumably because the differentially expressed genes reflect genuine differences in processes underlying disease pathogenesis.
CONCLUSION: Analysis of leucocyte subsets enabled the identification of gene signatures of both pathogenic relevance and with better disease discrimination than those identified in PBMC. This approach thus provides substantial advantages in the search for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in autoimmune disease.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0003911},
  abstract = {Background
Analysis of gene expression data using genome-wide microarrays is a technique often used in genomic studies to find coexpression patterns and locate groups of co-transcribed genes. However, most studies done at global ``omic'' scale are not focused on human samples and when they correspond to human very often include heterogeneous datasets, mixing normal with disease-altered samples. Moreover, the technical noise present in genome-wide expression microarrays is another well reported problem that many times is not addressed with robust statistical methods, and the estimation of errors in the data is not provided.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Human genome-wide expression data from a controlled set of normal-healthy tissues is used to build a confident human gene coexpression network avoiding both pathological and technical noise. To achieve this we describe a new method that combines several statistical and computational strategies: robust normalization and expression signal calculation; correlation coefficients obtained by parametric and non-parametric methods; random cross-validations; and estimation of the statistical accuracy and coverage of the data. All these methods provide a series of coexpression datasets where the level of error is measured and can be tuned. To define the errors, the rates of true positives are calculated by assignment to biological pathways. The results provide a confident human gene coexpression network that includes 3327 gene-nodes and 15841 coexpression-links and a comparative analysis shows good improvement over previously published datasets. Further functional analysis of a subset core network, validated by two independent methods, shows coherent biological modules that share common transcription factors. The network reveals a map of coexpression clusters organized in well defined functional constellations. Two major regions in this network correspond to genes involved in nuclear and mitochondrial metabolism and investigations on their functional assignment indicate that more than 60\% are house-keeping and essential genes. The network displays new non-described gene associations and it allows the placement in a functional context of some unknown non-assigned genes based on their interactions with known gene families.

Conclusions/Significance
The identification of stable and reliable human gene to gene coexpression networks is essential to unravel the interactions and functional correlations between human genes at an omic scale. This work contributes to this aim, and we are making available for the scientific community the validated human gene coexpression networks obtained, to allow further analyses on the network or on some specific gene associations.

  abstract = {The characterization of molecular changes in diseased tissues gives insight into pathophysiological mechanisms and is important for therapeutic development. Genome-wide gene expression analysis has proven valuable for identifying biological processes in neurodegenerative diseases using post mortem human brain tissue and numerous datasets are publically available. However, many studies utilize heterogeneous tissue samples consisting of multiple cell types, all of which contribute to global gene expression values, confounding biological interpretation of the data. In particular, changes in numbers of neuronal and glial cells occurring in neurodegeneration confound transcriptomic analyses, particularly in human brain tissues where sample availability and controls are limited. To identify cell specific gene expression changes in neurodegenerative disease, we have applied our recently published computational deconvolution method, population specific expression analysis (PSEA). PSEA estimates cell-type-specific expression values using reference expression measures, which in the case of brain tissue comprises mRNAs with cell-type-specific expression in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. As an exercise in PSEA implementation and hypothesis development regarding neurodegenerative diseases, we applied PSEA to Parkinson's and Huntington's disease (PD, HD) datasets. Genes identified as differentially expressed in substantia nigra pars compacta neurons by PSEA were validated using external laser capture microdissection data. Network analysis and Annotation Clustering (DAVID) identified molecular processes implicated by differential gene expression in specific cell types. The results of these analyses provided new insights into the implementation of PSEA in brain tissues and additional refinement of molecular signatures in human HD and PD.},

  abstract = {Fast-spiking (FS) interneurons are important elements of neocortical circuitry that constitute the primary source of synaptic inhibition in adult cortex and impart temporal organization on ongoing cortical activity. The highly specialized intrinsic membrane and firing properties that allow cortical FS interneurons to perform these functions are due to equally specialized gene expression, which is ultimately coordinated by cell-type-specific transcriptional regulation. While embryonic transcriptional events govern the initial steps of cell-type specification in most cortical interneurons, including FS cells, the electrophysiological properties that distinguish adult cortical cell types emerge relatively late in postnatal development, and the transcriptional events that drive this maturational process are not known. To address this, we used mouse whole-genome microarrays and whole-cell patch clamp to characterize the transcriptional and electrophysiological maturation of cortical FS interneurons between postnatal day 7 (P7) and P40. We found that the intrinsic and synaptic physiology of FS cells undergoes profound regulation over the first four postnatal weeks, and that these changes are correlated with largely monotonic but bidirectional transcriptional regulation of thousands of genes belonging to multiple functional classes. Using our microarray screen as a guide, we discovered that upregulation of 2-pore K+ leak channels between P10 and P25 contributes to one of the major differences between the intrinsic membrane properties of immature and adult FS cells, and found a number of other candidate genes that likely confer cell-type specificity on mature FS cells.},

  abstract = {Expression profiling of distinct central nervous system (CNS) cell populations has been employed to facilitate disease classification and to provide insights into the molecular basis of brain pathology. One important cell type implicated in a wide variety of CNS disease states is the resident brain macrophage (microglia). In these studies, microglia are often isolated from dissociated brain tissue by flow sorting procedures [fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)] or from postnatal glial cultures by mechanic isolation. Given the highly dynamic and state-dependent functions of these cells, the use of FACS or short-term culture methods may not accurately capture the biology of brain microglia. In the current study, we performed RNA-sequencing using Cx3cr1(+/GFP) labeled microglia isolated from the brainstem of 6-week-old mice to compare the transcriptomes of FACS-sorted versus laser capture microdissection (LCM). While both isolation techniques resulted in a large number of shared (common) transcripts, we identified transcripts unique to FACS-isolated and LCM-captured microglia. In particular, \ensuremath{\sim}50\% of these LCM-isolated microglial transcripts represented genes typically associated with neurons and glia. While these transcripts clearly localized to microglia using complementary methods, they were not translated into protein. Following the induction of murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, increased oligodendrocyte and neuronal transcripts were detected in microglia, while only the myelin basic protein oligodendrocyte transcript was increased in microglia after traumatic brain injury. Collectively, these findings have implications for the design and interpretation of microglia transcriptome-based investigations. GLIA 2014.},

We then compared our study (Charing Cross Hospital prospective collection) with that of an independent prefrontal cortex dataset from the Harvard Brain Bank. We report the first direct comparison between two independent studies. A total of 51 gene expression changes have been identified that are common between the schizophrenia cohorts, and 49 show the same direction of disease-associated regulation. In particular, changes were observed in gene sets associated with synaptic vesicle recycling, transmitter release and cytoskeletal dynamics.

  abstract = {In addition to catecholaminergic neurons possessing all the enzymes of catecholamine synthesis and the specific membrane transporters, neurons partly expressing the catecholaminergic phenotype have been found a quarter of a century ago. Most of them express individual enzymes of dopamine (DA) synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), or aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), lacking the DA membrane transporter and the vesicular monoamine transporter, type 2. These so-called monoenzymatic neurons are widely distributed throughout the brain in ontogenesis and adulthood being in some brain regions even more numerous than dopaminergic (DA-ergic) neurons. Individual enzymes of DA synthesis are expressed in these neurons continuously or transiently in norm and pathology. It has been proven that monoenzymatic TH neurons and AADC neurons are capable of producing DA in cooperation. It means that l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) synthesized from l-tyrosine in monoenzymatic TH neurons is transported to monoenzymatic AADC neurons for DA synthesis. Such cooperative synthesis of DA is considered as a compensatory reaction under a failure of DA-ergic neurons, for example, in neurodegenerative diseases like hyperprolactinemia and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, l-DOPA, produced in monoenzymatic TH neurons, is assumed to play a role of a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator affecting the target neurons via catecholamine receptors.

Thus, numerous widespread neurons expressing individual complementary enzymes of DA synthesis serve to produce DA in cooperation that is a compensatory reaction at failure of DA-ergic neurons.},

Traditional methods of high-throughput analysis rely on pooling gene expression data from hundreds of thousands of cells and reporting  a population-wide average that is unable to capture differences within distinct cell subsets. Recent advances in microfluidic technology have permitted the development of large-scale single cell analytic methods that overcome this limitation. The increased granularity afforded by such approaches allows us to answer the critical question of whether expansion in cell culture significantly alters the transcriptional characteristics of cells isolated from primary tissue. Here we examine an established population of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) using a novel, microfluidic-based method for high-throughput transcriptional interrogation, coupled with advanced bioinformatic analysis, to evaluate the dynamics of single cell gene expression among primary, passage 0, and passage 1 stem cells. We find significant differences in the transcriptional profiles of cells from each group, as well as  a considerable shift in subpopulation dynamics as those subgroups better able to adhere and proliferate under these culture conditions gradually emerge as dominant. Taken together, these findings reinforce the importance of using primary or very early passage cells in future studies.},

  abstract = {Background
Focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) are local disturbances of neocortical architecture and a common cause of pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsy. Little is known about the pathomechanisms leading to architectural abnormalities associated with FCD.

Results
In the present study we compared 52 FCD cases originating from the frontal or temporal lobe with or without Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS) with regard to structural and molecular differences. We applied layer-specific (ER81, ROR\ss{}, SMI32, TLE4) and interneuron (calbindin, parvalbumin) markers by means of immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization (ISH), and real time RT-PCR and correlated our findings with clinical parameters. We found that: (1) Structural abnormalities were most prominent in layers III-VI including changed morphology of individual neurons or dispersion, blurring and thinning of layers. These alterations were most pronounced in isolated frontal FCD, whereas the most homogeneous group was FCD IIIa. (2) Numbers of calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive interneurons varied considerably within the different FCD groups, but were not generally reduced. A significant decrease was only found for calbindin-positive interneurons in frontal FCD, and for parvalbumin-positive interneurons in FCD IIIa. (3) Interestingly, FCD IIIa presented with significant changes in the numbers of calbindin- or TLE4-positive neurons when compared to isolated FCD or controls. (4) Correlations between clinical and cellular parameters strongly depended on FCD localisation and age of the patients.

Conclusions
In summary, our data suggest that late cortical development is disturbed in FCD, yet most likely by different causes depending on brain region, FCD type and FCD severity.},

Other studies showed that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are responsible for the formation of new myelin in both the injured and the normal adult brain, and that glutamate released from neurons, via neuron\textendash{}OPC synapses, can inhibit OPC proliferation and affect their differentiation into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. Because glutamatergic transmission is higher in wake than in sleep, we asked whether sleep and wake can affect oligodendrocytes and OPCs. Using the translating ribosome affinity purification technology combined with microarray analysis in mice, we obtained a genome-wide profiling of oligodendrocytes after sleep, spontaneous wake, and forced wake (acute sleep deprivation). We found that hundreds of transcripts being translated in oligodendrocytes are differentially expressed in sleep and wake: genes involved in phospholipid synthesis and myelination or promoting OPC proliferation are transcribed preferentially during sleep, while genes implicated in apoptosis, cellular stress response, and OPC differentiation are enriched in wake. We then confirmed through BrdU and other experiments that OPC proliferation doubles during sleep and positively correlates with time spent in REM sleep, whereas OPC differentiation is higher during wake. Thus, OPC proliferation and differentiation are not perfectly matched at any given circadian time but preferentially occur during sleep and wake, respectively.},

To date, it is unknown whether oligodendrocytes play a role in these events. Methods: We performed a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of oligodendrocyte-associated changes induced by acute and chronic MPTP treatment, in the SN and striatum of mice and macaques respectively. Oligodendrocytes were immunolabelled by cell-specific markers and analysed by confocal microscopy. Results: In both experimental models, MPTP treatment induces an increase in oligodendrocyte cell number and average size, as well as in the total area occupied by this cell type per tissue section, accompanied by evident morphological changes. This multifaceted array of changes, herein referred to as oligodendrogliosis, significantly correlates with the reduction in the level of dopaminergic innervation to the striatum. Conclusions: This event, associated with early damage of the dopaminergic neurone axons and of the complex striatal circuits of which they are part, may result in an important, although neglected, aspect in the onset and progression of Parkinsonism.},

Here, we use Escherichia coli oligonucleotide microarrays to assay transcript expression of both open reading frames (ORFs) and intergenic regions. We then use hidden Markov models to analyse this expression data and estimate transcription boundaries of genes. This approach allows us to identify 5\ensuremath{'} untranslated regions (5\ensuremath{'} UTRs) of transcripts as well as genes that are likely to be operon members. The operon elements we identify correspond to documented operons with 99\% specificity and 63\% sensitivity. Similarly we find that our 5\ensuremath{'} UTR results accurately coincide with experimentally verified promoter regions for most genes.

It has been reported that Emx1 transcripts and the protein product are localized in most cells of the cerebral cortex during the process of proliferation, migration, differentiation and maturation. We provide evidence here, based on a multitude of experimental approaches in developing rats, in support of the hypothesis that the expression of this gene is restricted to pyramidal neurons. Specifically, we found that, similar to pyramidal neurons, cells expressing Emx1 are distributed in all cortical layers, except layer I. Using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry at the light and electron microscope levels, we have shown that the density, distribution, soma shape and ultrastructural features of these cells were identical to those of pyramidal neurons. Double-labelling experiments confirmed that the vast majority of Emx1-expressing cells also contained glutamate, a marker of pyramidal neurons. We also found that this gene is expressed by most glutamate-containing neurons in dissociated cortical cell cultures and the vast majority of cells in radially arranged clones of pyramidal cells in the cortices of chimeric mice. Thus, the homeobox gene Emx1 can be reliably used as a marker of the pyramidal cell lineage.},

Differentiated derivatives of human pluripotent stem cells in culture are generally phenotypically immature compared to their adult counterparts. Their identity is often difficult to determine with certainty because little is known about their human fetal equivalents in~vivo. Cellular identity and signaling pathways directing differentiation are usually determined by extrapolating information from either human adult tissue or model organisms, assuming conservation with humans. To resolve this, we generated a collection of human fetal transcriptional profiles at different developmental stages. Moreover, we developed an algorithm, KeyGenes, which uses this dataset to quantify the extent to which next-generation sequencing or microarray data resemble specific cell or tissue types in the human fetus. Using KeyGenes combined with the human fetal atlas, we identified multiple cell and tissue samples unambiguously on a limited set of features. We thus provide a flexible and expandable platform to monitor and evaluate the efficiency of differentiation in~vitro.},

Whereas GlialCAM binds ClC-2 and MLC1, and modifies ClC-2 currents in vitro, no functional connections between MLC1 and ClC-2 are known. Here we investigate this by generating loss-of-function Glialcam and Mlc1 mouse models manifesting myelin vacuolization. We find that ClC-2 is unnecessary for MLC1 and GlialCAM localization in brain, whereas GlialCAM is important for targeting MLC1 and ClC-2 to specialized glial domains in vivo and for modifying ClC-2's biophysical properties specifically in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the cells chiefly affected by vacuolization. Unexpectedly, MLC1 is crucial for proper localization of GlialCAM and ClC-2, and for changing ClC-2 currents. Our data unmask an unforeseen functional relationship between MLC1 and ClC-2 in vivo, which is probably mediated by GlialCAM, and suggest that ClC-2 participates in the pathogenesis of megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts.},

We identify Igf1 as one of several activity-regulated genes that are specific to VIP neurons, and demonstrate that IGF1 functions cell-autonomously in VIP neurons to increase inhibitory synaptic input onto these neurons. Our findings further suggest that in cortical VIP neurons, experience-dependent gene transcription regulates visual acuity by activating the expression of IGF1, thus promoting the inhibition of disinhibitory neurons and affecting inhibition onto cortical pyramidal neurons.},

  abstract = {In this study we have investigated the possible role of c-Jun and it{\^a}{\mbox{\texteuro}}\texttrademark{}s activation by the JNK pathway in neuronal cell death and in the inflammatory response of activated astrocytes. The first part of this thesis focuses on the role of site specific phosphorylation of c-Jun in neuronal cell death. The second part focuses on the function of c-Jun in LPS-mediated activation of Bergmann glia cells. In the nervous system, activation of c-Jun transcription factor by different isoforms of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) functions in various cellular programs, including neurite outgrowth, repair and apoptosis. Yet, the regulatory mechanism underlying the functional dichotomy of c-Jun remains to be elucidated. Serine (S) 63/73 and threonine (T) 91/93 of c-Jun are the target phosphorylation sites for JNKs in response to various stimuli. Yet, these two groups of phosphorylation sites are differentially regulated in vivo, as the S63/73 sites are promptly phosphorylated upon JNK activation, whereas T91/93 phosphorylation requires a priming event at the adjacent T95 site. In our study, we used cerebellar granule cell (CGC) apoptosis by trophic/potassium (TK) deprivation as a model system to investigate the regulation and function of site-specific c-Jun phosphorylation at the S63 and T91/T93 JNK-sites in neuronal cell death. In this model system, JNK induces pro-apoptotic genes through the c-Jun/Ap-1 transcription factor. On the other side, a survival pathway initiated by lithium leads to repression of pro-apoptotic c-Jun/Ap-1 target genes without interfering with JNK activity. Yet, the mechanism by which lithium inhibits c-Jun activity remains to be elucidated. We found that TK-deprivation led to c-Jun phosphorylation at all three JNK sites. However, immunofluorescence analysis of c-Jun phosphorylation at single cell level revealed that the S63 site was phosphorylated in all c-Jun-expressing cells, whereas the response of T91/T93 phosphorylation was more sensitive, mirroring the switch-like apoptotic response of cerebellar granular cells (CGCs). Furthermore, we observed that lithium impaired c-Jun phosphorylation at T91/93, without interfering with S63/73 phosphorylation or JNK activation, suggesting that T91/T93 phosphorylation triggers c-Jun pro-apoptotic activity. Notably, expression of a c-Jun mutant lacking the T95-priming site for T91/93 phosphorylation (c-Jun A95) mimicked the effect of lithium on both cell death and c-Jun site-specific phosphorylation, whereas it was fully able to induce neurite outgrowth in na{\~A}\textasciimacron{}ve PC12 cells. Vice-versa, a c-Jun mutant bearing aspartate-substitution of T95 overwhelmed lithium-mediate protection of CGCs from TK-deprivation, validating that inhibition of T91/T93/T95 phosphorylation underlies the effect of lithium on cell death. Mass-spectrometry analysis confirmed that c-Jun is phosphorylation at T91/T93/T95 in cells. Moreover, recombinant-JNK phosphorylated c-Jun at T91/T93 in a T95-dependent manner. Based on our results, we propose that T91/T93/T95 phosphorylation of c-Jun functions as a sensitivity amplifier of the JNK cascade, setting the threshold for c-Jun pro-apoptotic activity in neuronal cells. In the central nervous system (CNS), the c-Jun transcription factor has been mainly studied in neuronal cells and coupled to apoptotic and regenerative pathways following brain injury. Besides, several studies have shown a transcriptional role of c-Jun in activated cortical and spinal astrocytes. In contrast, little is known about c-Jun expression and activation in Bergmann glial (BG) cells, the radial cerebellar astrocytes playing crucial roles in cerebellar development and physiology. In this study, we used neuronal/glial cerebellar cultures from neonatal mice to assess putative functions of c-Jun in BG cells. By performing double immunocytochemical staining of c-Jun and two BG specific markers, S100 and GLAST, we observed that c-Jun was highly expressed in radial glial cells derived from Bergmann glia. Bergmann glia-derived cells expressed toll-like receptor (TLR 4) and treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Le et al.) induced c-Jun phosphorylation at S63, exclusively in BG cells. Moreover, LPS induced IL-1{\^I}\ensuremath{^2} expression and inhibition of JNK activity abolished both c-Jun phosphorylation and the increase of IL-1{\^I}\ensuremath{^2} mRNA. Notably, we also observed that LPS failed to induce IL-1{\^I}\ensuremath{^2} mRNA in neuronal/glial cerebellar cultures generated from conditional knockout mice lacking c-Jun expression in the CNS. These results indicate that c-Jun plays a central role in c-Jun in astroglial-specific induction of IL-1{\^I}\ensuremath{^2}. Furthermore, we confirmed in vivo that c-Jun is expressed in BG cells, during the formation of the BG monolayer. Altogether, our finding underlines a putative role of c-Jun in astroglia-mediated neuroinflammatory dysfunctions of the cerebellum., In dieser Studie wurde die Rolle des Transkriptionsfaktors c-Jun sowie seine Aktivierung durch den JNK Signalweg beim neuronalen Zelltod und bei der entz{\"u}ndlichen Reaktion von aktivierten Astrozyten untersucht. Der erste Teil dieser Arbeit besch{\"a}ftigt sich mit der Rolle von mehrfacher c-Jun Phosphorylierung an den Aminos{\"a}uren Threonin 91/93/95 beim neuronalen Zelltod. Der zweite Teil konzentriert sich auf die Rolle von c-Jun und seine Transaktivierung in LPS-vermittelter Aktivierung von Bergmann Gliazellen. Als Modellsystem f{\"u}r den neuronalen Zelltod wurde die Apoptose von cerebell{\"a}ren Granularzellen (CGC) durch trophische Granulazellen Kaliumkonzentration-Erniedrigung (TK) verwendet, da es ein Modell der Um das ist, das Zusammenspiel von pro-apoptotischen und pro-{\"U}berleben Signalwegen beim neuronalen Zelltod zu studieren. In diesem Modell induziert die c-Jun N-terminale Kinase (JNK) pro-apoptotische Gene durch den c-Jun/Ap-1 Transkriptionsfaktor. Auf der anderen Seite, f{\"u}hrt ein Lithium-induzierter {\"U}berleben-Signalweg zur Unterdr{\"u}ckung der pro-apoptotischen c-Jun/Ap-1 Zielgene, ohne Interferenz mit JNK Aktivit{\"a}t. Es blieb jedoch der Mechanismus zu kl{\"a}ren, durch den Lithium c-Jun-Aktivit{\"a}t hemmt. In der Arbeit wurde dieses Modellsystem benutzt, um die Regulation und Funktion der c-Jun-Phosphorylierung durch JNK an den Stellen S63 und T91/T93 beim neuronalen Zelltod zu studieren. Es wurde gefunden, dass TK-Kaliumerniedrigung zu c-Jun phosphorylierung f{\"u}hrte und zwar an allen drei durch JNK phosphorylierbaren Ser/Thr (JNK-Stellen). Immunfluoreszenzanalyse von c-Jun Phosphorylierung auf Einzel-Zell-Ebene ergab jedoch, dass die S63-Stelle in allen c-Jun-exprimierenden Zellen phosphoryliert wurde, w{\"a}hrend T91/T93 Phosphorylierung empfindlicher war, analog zur Schalter-{\"a}hnlichen apoptotischen Antwort von CGCs. Umgekehrt verhinderte Lithium T91 und T93 Phosphorylierung und Zelltod ohne Wirkung auf die S63-Seite, was darauf hindeutet, dass T91/T93 Phosphorylierung durch c-Jun eine pro-apoptotische Aktivit{\"a}t ausl{\"o}st. Dementsprechend sch{\"u}tzte eine c-Jun-Mutation, der die T95 Priming-Stelle f{\"u}r T91/93 Phosphorylierung fehlt (T95A), CGCs vor Apoptose, wohingegen T95A Neuriten-wachstum in PC12-Zellen induzieren konnte. Umgekehrt f{\"u}hrte eine c-Jun Mutante mit Aspartat-Substitution von T95 (T95D ) zur Aufhebung der sch{\"u}tzenden Wirkung von Lithium auf CGC Apoptose, wodurch best{\"a}tigt wurde, dass die Inhibierung der T91/T93/T95 Phosphorylierung der Wirkung von Lithium auf den Zelltod zugrundeliegt. Massenspektrometrie-Analyse best{\"a}tigte multiple Phosphorylierung von c-Jun an T91/T93/T95 in den Zellen. Au\ss{}erdem wurde rekombinantes c-Jun durch JNK an T91/T93 in einer T95-abh{\"a}ngigen Weise phosphoryliert. Basierend auf diesen Ergebnissen wird vorgeschlagen, dass T91/T93/T95 phosphorylierung von c-Jun als Empfindlichkeit-Verst{\"a}rker der JNK-Kaskade fungiert, der die Schwelle f{\"u}r die pro-apoptotische Aktivit{\"a}t von c-Jun in neuronalen Zellen einstellt. Im zentralen Nervensystem (ZNS) wurde die Rolle des c-Jun Transkriptionsfaktors haupts{\"a}chlich bei neuronalem Zelltod und bei neuronaler Regeneration nach Hirnsch{\"a}digung untersucht. Au\ss{}erdem wurde auch eine Rolle f{\"u}r c-Jun bei der Transkription in aktivierten kortikalen und spinalen Astrozyten beschrieben. Im Gegensatz dazu ist wenig bekannt {\"u}ber die Expression von c-Jun und dessen Transaktivierung in Bergmann Gliazellen (BG)-Zellen, die eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Entwicklung des Kleinhirns und dessen Physiologie spielen. In dieser Arbeit wurde die putative Rolle von c-Jun bei kultivierten neuronalen/BG-Zellen aus dem Maus-Kleinhirn untersucht. Immunfluoreszenzanalyse von c-Jun und zwei f{\"u}r BG-Zellen spezifische Marker, S100 und GLAST, ergab, dass c-Jun in BG-Zellen hoch exprimiert wurde. Au\ss{}erdem wurde gefunden, dass der Toll-like Rezeptor TLR4 in BG-Zellen exprimiert ist und dass die Behandlung mit bakteriellem Lipopolysaccharid (Le et al.) die c-Jun- Phosphorylierung an S63 induziert. Zus{\"a}tzlich wurde gefunden, dass LPS IL-1b Expression induziert und die Inhibierung von JNK Aktivit{\"a}t verhinderte sowohl c-Jun-Phosphorylierung, als auch die Zunahme von IL-1 b mRNA. Insbesondere konnte LPS die IL-1b mRNA-Produktion in neuronalen / BG-Kulturen aus konditionellen Knockout M{\"a}usen, denen c-Jun im ZNS fehlte, nicht induzieren, womit gezeigt wurde, dass c-Jun bei der Astroglia-spezifischen Induktion von IL-1 b essentiell ist. Immunohistochemische Analyse von c-Jun-exprimierenden Zellen im postnatalen Kleinhirn best{\"a}tigte in-vivo die Expression von c-Jun in BG Zellen und f{\"o}rderte eine dynamische Expression von c-Jun w{\"a}hrend der Entwicklung der BG Monolayer zutage. Insgesamt unterstreichen die Befunde dieser Arbeit eine wahrscheinliche Rolle von c-Jun bei Astroglia-vermittelten neuroinflammatorischen Funktionsst{\"o}rungen des Kleinhirns.},

  abstract = {We successfully isolated a rat cDNA clone encoding a novel EF hand protein with a molecular weight of about 17 kDa and designated this gene iba1 (ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1). The genomic copy of the iba1 gene was located within a segment of the major histocompatibility complex class III region between the Bat2 and TNF alpha genes. The iba1 gene was shown to be highly expressed in testis and spleen, but weakly expressed in brain, lung, and kidney. Among brain cells, the iba1 gene was specifically expressed in microglia. A screening of hemopoietic cell lines showed that the Iba1 protein was clearly expressed in monoblastic cell lines but only very weakly expressed in myeloid cell lines. Iba1 protein is therefore suggested to act as an adapter molecule, mediating calcium signals that may function in a monocytic lineage including microglia.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the diversity of cortical GABAergic interneurons is critical to understand the function of the cerebral cortex. Recent data suggest that neurons expressing three markers, the Ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin (PV), the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST), and the ionotropic serotonin receptor 5HT3a (5HT3aR) account for nearly 100\% of neocortical interneurons. Interneurons expressing each of these markers have a different embryological origin. Each group includes several types of interneurons that differ in morphological and electrophysiological properties and likely have different functions in the cortical circuit. The PV group accounts for \ensuremath{\sim}40\% of GABAergic neurons and includes fast spiking basket cells and chandelier cells. The SST group, which represents \ensuremath{\sim}30\% of GABAergic neurons, includes the Martinotti cells and a set of neurons that specifically target layerIV. The 5HT3aR group, which also accounts for \ensuremath{\sim}30\% of the total interneuronal population, is heterogeneous and includes all of the neurons that express the neuropeptide VIP, as well as an equally numerous subgroup of neurons that do not express VIP and includes neurogliaform cells. The universal modulation of these neurons by serotonin and acetylcholine via ionotropic receptors suggests that they might be involved in shaping cortical circuits during specific brain states and behavioral contexts.},

In dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, the respective synthesizing enzymes. TH and TrH, were distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the neuronal perikarya, dendrites, axons and terminals. The most selective accumulation of reaction product for the specific enzyme was associated: (a) in perikarya with endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and microtubules, (b) in processes with microtubules, and (c) in terminals with dense granules or clear vesicles. The labeled terminals were characterized by their content of labeled organelles and the absence of synaptic junctions. In noradrenergic neurons, both TH and DBH were localized in the perikarya, similar to TH in dopamine neurons. TH and DBH differed in their localization within proximal axons and dendrites in that TH was associated with microtubules but DBH was not. These results provide ultrastructural evidence to suggest that monoamines may be: (a) synthesized by enzymes which are associated with different organelles depending on the portion of the neuron and the type of enzyme; (b) synthesized in both axons and dendrites and (c) released from terminals without postsynaptic membrane specializations.},

Approximately 270 genes in humans and 550 genes in mice were differentially expressed between subsets by 2-fold or more. More than 130 of these gene expression differences were conserved between mouse and human monocyte subsets. We confirmed numerous of these differences at the cell surface protein level. Despite overall conservation, some molecules were conversely expressed between the 2 species' subsets, including CD36, CD9, and TREM-1. Other differences included a prominent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) signature in mouse monocytes, which is absent in humans, and strikingly opposed patterns of receptors involved in uptake of apoptotic cells and other phagocytic cargo between human and mouse monocyte subsets. Thus, whereas human and mouse monocyte subsets are far more broadly conserved than currently recognized, important differences between the species deserve consideration when models of human disease are studied in mice.},

In this paper, we demonstrate how this classification can be applied to study two well-characterized myopathies: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Using skeletal muscle profile data from ALS and DMD patients compared with that from normal subjects, normal young in the case of DMD, we delineate molecular mechanisms that are causative and consequential to skeletal muscle dysfunction. In ALS, our analysis establishes the metabolic role and specifically identifies the mechanisms of calcium dysregulation and defects in mitochondrial transport of materials as important for muscle dysfunction. In DMD, we illustrate how impaired mechanical function is strongly coordinated with other three functional networks, resulting in transformation of the skeletal muscle into hybrid forms as a compensatory mechanism. Our functional models also provide, in exquisite detail, the mechanistic role of myriad proteins in these four families in normal and disease function.},

However, the data produced by the thousands of microarray studies published annually are confounded by ``batch effects,'' the systematic error introduced when samples are processed in multiple batches. Although batch effects can be reduced by careful experimental design, they cannot be eliminated unless the whole study is done in a single batch. A number of programs are now available to adjust microarray data for batch effects prior to analysis. We systematically evaluated six of these programs using multiple measures of precision, accuracy and overall performance. ComBat, an Empirical Bayes method, outperformed the other five programs by most metrics. We also showed that it is essential to standardize expression data at the probe level when testing for correlation of expression profiles, due to a sizeable probe effect in microarray data that can inflate the correlation among replicates and unrelated samples.},

The distribution of Rip immunoreactivity coincides with that of myelinated axons in both the spinal cord and the cerebellum. In addition, doubleimmunolabeling experiments demonstrate that Rip stains processes containing myelin basic protein but does not stain processes that express glial fibrillary acidic protein. These results indicate that Rip selectively stains oligodendrocytes but not astrocytes. Moreover, individual Rip-stained oligodendroglial somata and their cytoplasmic processes were observable at both the light microscopic and electron microscopic level when the staining of myelin was reduced. This was accomplished by omitting detergents from antibody incubation steps. Rip-stained oligodendrocytes have multiple processes of varying thickness, some of which end in close proximity to myelin sheaths. These immunostained profiles, reminiscent of those observed in oligodendrocytes stained by Golgi methods, are unique to Rip and indicate that its immunoreactivity is distinct from that of existing serological markers for oligodendrocytes.},

  abstract = {The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of hundreds of distinct cell types, each expressing different subsets of genes from the genome. High throughput gene expression analysis of the CNS from patients and controls is a common method to screen for potentially pathological molecular mechanisms of psychiatric disease. One mechanism by which gene expression might be seen to vary across samples would be alterations in the cellular composition of the tissue. While the expressions of gene ``markers'' for each cell type can provide certain information of cellularity, for many rare cell types markers are not well characterized. Moreover, if only small sets of markers are known, any substantial variation of a marker's expression pattern due to experiment conditions would result in poor sensitivity and specificity. Here, our proposed method combines prior information from mice cell-specific transcriptome profiling experiments with co-expression network analysis, to select large sets of potential cell type-specific gene markers in a systematic and unbiased manner. The method is efficient and robust, and identifies sufficient markers for further cellularity analysis. We then employ the markers to analytically detect changing cellular composition in human brain. Application of our method to temporal human brain microarray data successfully detects changes in cellularity over time that roughly correspond to known epochs of human brain development. Furthermore, application of our method to human brain samples with the neurodevelopmental disorder of autism supports the interpretation that the changes in astrocytes and neurons might contribute to the disorder.},

Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission.

Microarray technologies can be powerful, with limitations, when applied to the analysis of human brain disorders. Recently, using cDNA microarrays, altered gene expression patterns between subjects with schizophrenia and controls were shown. Functional data mining led to two novel discoveries: a consistent decrease in the group of transcripts encoding proteins that regulate presynaptic function; and the most changed gene, which has never been previously associated with schizophrenia, regulator of G-protein signaling 4. From these and other findings, a hypothesis has been formulated to suggest that schizophrenia is a disease of the synapse. In the context of a neurodevelopmental model, it is proposed that impaired mechanics of synaptic transmission in specific neural circuits during childhood and adolescence ultimately results in altered synapse formation or pruning, or both, which manifest in the clinical onset of the disease.},

  abstract = {With aging, significant changes in circadian rhythms occur, including a shift in phase toward a "morning" chronotype and a loss of rhythmicity in circulating hormones. However, the effects of aging on molecular rhythms in the human brain have remained elusive. Here, we used a previously described time-of-death analysis to identify transcripts throughout the genome that have a significant circadian rhythm in expression in the human prefrontal cortex [Brodmann's area 11 (BA11) and BA47]. Expression levels were determined by microarray analysis in 146 individuals. Rhythmicity in expression was found in \ensuremath{\sim} 10\% of detected transcripts (P \ensuremath{<} 0.05). Using a metaanalysis across the two brain areas, we identified a core set of 235 genes (q \ensuremath{<} 0.05) with significant circadian rhythms of expression. These 235 genes showed 92\% concordance in the phase of expression between the two areas. In addition to the canonical core circadian genes, a number of other genes were found to exhibit rhythmic expression in the brain. Notably, we identified more than 1,000 genes (1,186 in BA11; 1,591 in BA47) that exhibited age-dependent rhythmicity or alterations in rhythmicity patterns with aging. Interestingly, a set of transcripts gained rhythmicity in older individuals, which may represent a compensatory mechanism due to a loss of canonical clock function. Thus, we confirm that rhythmic gene expression can be reliably measured in human brain and identified for the first time (to our knowledge) significant changes in molecular rhythms with aging that may contribute to altered cognition, sleep, and mood in later life.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease and its characteristic symptoms are thought to arise from the progressive degeneration of specific midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons. In humans, DA neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) and their projections to the striatum show selective vulnerability, while neighboring DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are relatively spared from degeneration. This pattern of cell loss is mimicked in humans, primates, and certain rodents by the neurotoxin MPTP. In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that there are factors in the VTA that are potentially neuroprotective against MPTP and that these factors change over time. We have found a dynamic transcriptional response within the cells of the VTA to sustained exposure to a low dose of MPTP. Specifically, the VTA has increased expression of 148 genes as an early response to MPTP and 113 genes as a late response to MPTP toxicity. This response encompasses many areas of cellular function, including protein regulation (Phf6) and ion/metal regulation (PANK2 and Car4). Notably, these responses were largely absent from the cells of the SN. Our data show a clear dynamic response in maintaining the homeostasis and viability of the neurons in the VTA that is lacking in the SN after neurotoxin challenge.},

  abstract = {During the last two decades numerous genetic approaches affecting cell function in vivo have been developed. Current state-of-the-art technology permits the selective switching of gene function in distinct cell populations within the complex organization of a given tissue parenchyma. The tamoxifen-inducible Cre/loxP gene recombination and the doxycycline-dependent modulation of gene expression are probably the most popular genetic paradigms. Here, we will review applications of these two strategies while focusing on the interactions of astrocytes and neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and their impact for the whole organism. Abolishing glial sensing of neuronal activity by selective deletion of glial transmitter receptors demonstrated the impact of astrocytes for higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory, or the more basic body control of muscle coordination. Interestingly, also interfering with glial output, i.e., the release of gliotransmitters can drastically change animal's physiology like sleeping behavior. Furthermore, such genetic approaches have also been used to restore astrocyte function. In these studies two alternatives were employed to achieve proper genetic targeting of astrocytes: transgenes using the promoter of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or homologous recombination into the glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) locus. We will highlight their specific properties that could be relevant for their use.},

  abstract = {To respond to potential adverse exposures properly, health care providers need accurate indicators of exposure levels. The indicators are particularly important in the case of acetaminophen (APAP) intoxication, the leading cause of liver failure in the U.S. We hypothesized that gene expression patterns derived from blood cells would provide useful indicators of acute exposure levels. To test this hypothesis, we used a blood gene expression data set from rats exposed to APAP to train classifiers in two prediction algorithms and to extract patterns for prediction using a profiling algorithm. Prediction accuracy was tested on a blinded, independent rat blood test data set and ranged from 88.9\% to 95.8\%. Genomic markers outperformed predictions based on traditional clinical parameters. The expression profiles of the predictor genes from the patterns extracted from the blood exhibited remarkable (97\% accuracy) transtissue APAP exposure prediction when liver gene expression data were used as a test set. Analysis of human samples revealed separation of APAP-intoxicated patients from control individuals based on blood expression levels of human orthologs of the rat discriminatory genes. The major biological signal in the discriminating genes was activation of an inflammatory response after exposure to toxic doses of APAP. These results support the hypothesis that gene expression data from peripheral blood cells can provide valuable information about exposure levels, well before liver damage is detected by classical parameters. It also supports the potential use of genomic markers in the blood as surrogates for clinical markers of potential acute liver damage.},

  abstract = {The mammalian cerebral cortex supports cognitive functions such as sensorimotor integration, memory, and social behaviors. Normal brain function relies on a diverse set of differentiated cell types, including neurons, glia, and vasculature. Here, we have used large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to classify cells in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampal CA1 region. We found 47 molecularly distinct subclasses, comprising all known major cell types in the cortex. We identified numerous marker genes, which allowed alignment with known cell types, morphology, and location. We found a layer I interneuron expressing Pax6 and a distinct postmitotic oligodendrocyte subclass marked by Itpr2. Across the diversity of cortical cell types, transcription factors formed a complex, layered regulatory code, suggesting a mechanism for the maintenance of adult cell type identity.
Cellular diversity in the brain revealed
The mammalian brain has an extraordinarily large number of cells. Although there are quite a few different cell types, many cells in any one category tend to look alike. Zeisel et al. analyzed the transcriptomes of mouse brain cells to reveal more than meets the eye. Interneurons of similar type were found in dissimilar regions of the brain. Oligodendrocytes that seemed to be all of one class were differentiated by their molecular signatures into a half-dozen classes. Microglia associated with blood vessels were distinguished from look-alike perivascular macrophages. Thus, the complex microanatomy of the brain can be revealed by the RNAs expressed in its cells.

Five of these populations were chosen from cingulate cortex and included several subtypes of GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal neurons. The remaining seven were derived from the somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus. Using these expression profiles, we were able to construct a taxonomic tree that reflected the expected major relationships between these populations, such as the distinction between cortical interneurons and projection neurons. The taxonomic tree indicated highly heterogeneous gene expression even within a single region. This dataset should be useful for the classification of unknown neuronal subtypes, the investigation of specifically expressed genes and the genetic manipulation of specific neuronal circuit elements.},

  abstract = {Bergmann glial cells play critical roles in the structure and function of the cerebellum. During development, their radial processes serve as guides for migrating granule neurons and their terminal endfeet tile to form the glia limitans. As the cerebellum matures, Bergmann glia perform important roles in synaptic transmission and synapse maintenance, while continuing to serve as essential structural elements. Despite growing evidence of the diverse functions of Bergmann glia, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these functions have remained largely unknown. As a step toward identifying the molecular repertoire underlying Bergmann glial function, here we examine global gene expression in individual Bergmann glia from developing (P6) and mature (P30) mouse cerebellum. When we select for developmentally regulated genes, we find that transcription factors and ribosomal genes are particularly enriched at P6 relative to P30; whereas synapse associated molecules are enriched at P30 relative to P6. We also analyze genes expressed at high levels at both ages. In all these categories, we find genes that were not previously known to be expressed in glial cells, and discuss novel functions some of these genes may potentially play in Bergmann glia. We also show that Bergmann glia, even in the adult, express a large set of genes thought to be specific to stem cells, suggesting that Bergmann glia may retain neural precursor potential as has been proposed. Finally, we highlight several genes that in the cerebellum are expressed in Bergmann glia but not astrocytes, and may therefore serve as new, specific markers for Bergmann glia.},

Taking the known similarities between astrocytes and enteric glia into account, we sought to investigate whether enteric glial cells also express Aldh1L1. To this end, we performed immunostaining on preparations of myenteric plexus obtained from adult Aldh1L1-eGFP bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice and found that the Aldh1L1 promoter is indeed active in enteric glia, albeit mainly in cells residing outside the myenteric ganglia. Apart from enteric glia, we also observed eGFP expression in interstitial cells of Cajal. Furthermore, myenteric ganglia of the large intestine contained eGFP positive neurons.

  abstract = {Expression profiling of restricted neural populations using microarrays can facilitate neuronal classification and provide insight into the molecular bases of cellular phenotypes. Due to the formidable heterogeneity of intermixed cell types that make up the brain, isolating cell types prior to microarray processing poses steep technical challenges that have been met in various ways. These methodological differences have the potential to distort cell-type-specific gene expression profiles insofar as they may insufficiently filter out contaminating mRNAs or induce aberrant cellular responses not normally present in vivo. Thus we have compared the repeatability, susceptibility to contamination from off-target cell-types, and evidence for stress-responsive gene expression of five different purification methods - Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP), Immunopanning (PAN), Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), and manual sorting of fluorescently labeled cells (Manual). We found that all methods obtained comparably high levels of repeatability, however, data from LCM and TRAP showed significantly higher levels of contamination than the other methods. While PAN samples showed higher activation of apoptosis-related, stress-related and immediate early genes, samples from FACS and Manual studies, which also require dissociated cells, did not. Given that TRAP targets actively translated mRNAs, whereas other methods target all transcribed mRNAs, observed differences may also reflect translational regulation.},

Treg cells represent important targets for therapeutic interventions of the immune system. Therefore, it will be very important to understand in more detail which genes are specifically activated in Treg cells versus T helper (Th) cells, and which gene regulatory circuits may be involved in specifying and maintaining Treg cell homeostasis.
RESULTS: We isolated Treg and Th cells from a genetically diverse family of 31 BXD type recombinant inbred strains and the fully inbred parental strains of this family--C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. Subsequently genome-wide gene expression studies were performed from the isolated Treg and Th cells. A comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of these cell populations allowed us to identify many novel differentially expressed genes. Analysis of cis- and trans-expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) highlighted common and unique regulatory mechanisms that are active in the two cell types. Trans-eQTL regions were found for the Treg functional genes Nrp1, Stat3 and Ikzf4. Analyses of the respective QTL intervals suggested several candidate genes that may be involved in regulating these genes in Treg cells. Similarly, possible candidate genes were found which may regulate the expression of F2rl1, Ctla4, Klrb1f. In addition, we identified a focused group of candidate genes that may be important for the maintenance of self-tolerance and the prevention of allergy.
CONCLUSIONS: Variation of expression across the strains allowed us to find many novel gene-interaction networks in both T cell subsets. In addition, these two data sets enabled us to identify many differentially expressed genes and to nominate candidate genes that may have important functions for the maintenance of self-tolerance and the prevention of allergy.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To present a comprehensive review of the existing neuropsychological and neuroimaging literature on bipolar affective disorder. This review critically evaluates two common conceptions regarding the neuropsychology of bipolar disorder: 1) that, in contrast to schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder is not associated with general cognitive impairment independent of illness episodes, and 2) relative right hemisphere (RH) dysfunction is implicated in bipolar illness patients, supported by reports of relatively greater impairment in visuospatial functioning, lateralization abnormalities, and mania secondary to RH lesions.  Methods: The major computerized databases (Medline and PSYCInfo) were consulted in order to conduct a comprehensive, integrated review of the literature on the neuropsychology and neuroanatomy of bipolar disorder. Articles meeting specified criteria were included in this review.  Results: In a critical evaluation of the above notions, this paper determines that: 1) while there is little evidence for selective RH dysfunction, significant cognitive impairment may be present in bipolar illness, particularly in a subgroup of chronic, elderly or multiple-episode patients, suggesting a possible toxic disease process, and 2) the underlying functional correlate of these cognitive deficits may be white matter lesions (`signal hyperintensities') in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia, regions critical for executive function, attention, speeded information processing, learning and memory, and affect regulation. While this hypothesized neural correlate of cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder is speculative, preliminary functional neuroimaging evidence supports the notion of frontal and subcortical hypometabolism in bipolar illness.  Conclusions: The etiology of the structural brain abnormalities commonly seen in bipolar illness, and their corresponding functional deficits, remains unknown. It is possible that neurodevelopmental anomalies may play a role, and it remains to be determined whether there is also some pathophysiological progression that occurs with repeated illness episodes. More research is needed on first-episode patients, relatives of bipolar probands, and within prospective longitudinal paradigms in order to isolate disease-specific impairments and genetic markers of neurocognitive function in bipolar disorder.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Measurement precision determines the power of any analysis to reliably identify significant signals, such as in screens for differential expression, independent of whether the experimental design incorporates replicates or not. With the compilation of large-scale RNA-Seq datasets with technical replicate samples, however, we can now, for the first time, perform a systematic analysis of the precision of expression level estimates from massively parallel sequencing technology. This then allows considerations for its improvement by computational or experimental means.
Results: We report on a comprehensive study of target identification and measurement precision, including their dependence on transcript expression levels, read depth and other parameters. In particular, an impressive recall of 84\% of the estimated true transcript population could be achieved with 331 million 50 bp reads, with diminishing returns from longer read lengths and even less gains from increased sequencing depths. Most of the measurement power (75\%) is spent on only 7\% of the known transcriptome, however, making less strongly expressed transcripts harder to measure. Consequently, \ensuremath{<}30\% of all transcripts could be quantified reliably with a relative error \ensuremath{<}20\%. Based on established tools, we then introduce a new approach for mapping and analysing sequencing reads that yields substantially improved performance in gene expression profiling, increasing the number of transcripts that can reliably be quantified to over 40\%. Extrapolations to higher sequencing depths highlight the need for efficient complementary steps. In discussion we outline possible experimental and computational strategies for further improvements in quantification precision.

However, the identity of Rip-antigen has yet to be elucidated. We herein identified the Rip-antigen. No signal recognized by mAb-Rip was detected by immunoblot analyses in the rat brain, cultured rat oligodendrocytes, or the oligodendrocyte cell line CG-4. As this antibody worked very well on immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry, Rip-antigen was immunopurified with mAb-Rip from the differentiated CG-4 cells. Eight strong-intensity bands thus appeared on 5\textendash{}20\% SDS-PAGE with SYPRO ruby fluorescence staining. To identify these molecules, each band extracted from the gel was analyzed by MALDI-QIT/TOF mass spectrometry. We found an interesting molecule in the oligodendrocytes from an approximately 44-kDa band as 2\ensuremath{'},3\ensuremath{'}-cyclic nucleotide 3\ensuremath{'}-phosphodiesterase (CNP). To test whether CNP was recognized by mAb-Rip, double-immunofluorescence staining was performed by using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated mAb-Rip and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated mAb-CNP in the rat cerebellum, mouse cerebellum, cultured rat oligodendrocytes, and CG-4 cells. The Rip-antigen was colocalized with CNP in these cells and tissues. To provide direct evidence that CNP was recognized by mAb-Rip, rat Cnp1-transfected HEK293T cells were used for double-immunofluorescence staining with mAb-Rip and mAb-CNP. The Rip-antigen was colocalized with CNP in rat Cnp1-transfected HEK293T cells, but the antigen was not detected by mAb-Rip and mAb-CNP in mock-transfected HEK293T cells. Overall, we have demonstrated that the antigen labeled with mAb-Rip is CNP in the oligodendrocytes. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Antigen emergence rapidly stimulates T cells, which leads to changes in cytokine production, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Some of the key molecules involved in these events, such as TGF-\ensuremath{\beta}1 and NOTCH1, are synthesized initially as inactive precursors and are proteolytically activated during T cell activation. PCSKs regulate proprotein maturation by catalyzing the proteolytic cleavage of their substrates. The prototype PCSK FURIN is induced upon TCR activation, and its expression in T cells is critical for the maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that FURIN regulates T cell activation. Our data demonstrate that IL-2 is increased initially in FURIN-deficient mouse CD4(+) T cells, but the TCR-induced IL-2 mRNA expression is not sustained in the absence of FURIN. Accordingly, the inhibition of FURIN in human Jurkat T cell lines also results in a decrease in IL-2 production, whereas the overexpression of WT FURIN is associated with elevated IL-2 levels. In Jurkat cells, FURIN is dispensable for immediate TCR signaling steps, such as ERK, ZAP70, or LAT phosphorylation. However, with the use of gene reporter assays, we demonstrate that FURIN regulates the AP-1, NFAT, and NF-\ensuremath{\kappa}B transcription factors. Finally, by performing a transcription factor-binding site enrichment analysis on FURIN-dependent transcriptomes, we identify the FURIN-regulated transcription factors in mouse CD4(+) T cell subsets. Collectively, our work confirms the hypothesis that the TCR-regulated protease FURIN plays an important role in T cell activation and that it can specifically modulate TCR-activated transactivation.},

The purpose of this study was to identify changes in gene expression early in the course of illness, when mechanisms of injury may provide the most relevant treatment and prognostic targets. We collected whole blood RNA in critically ill patients admitted from the Emergency Department to the intensive care unit within 24 h of admission at a tertiary care center. Whole genome expression was compared in patients with sepsis and ARDS to patients with sepsis alone. We selected genes with \ensuremath{>}1 log2 fold change and false discovery rate \ensuremath{<}0.25, determined their significance in the literature, and performed pathway analysis. Several genes were upregulated in 29 patients with sepsis with ARDS compared with 28 patients with sepsis alone. The most differentially expressed genes included key mediators of the initial neutrophil response to infection: olfactomedin 4, lipocalin 2, CD24, and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein. These gene expression differences withstood adjustment for age, sex, study batch, white blood cell count, and presence of pneumonia or aspiration. Pathway analysis demonstrated overrepresentation of genes involved in known respiratory and infection pathways. These data indicate that several neutrophil-related pathways may be involved in the early pathogenesis of sepsis-related ARDS. In addition, identifiable gene expression differences occurring early in the course of sepsis-related ARDS may further elucidate understanding of the neutrophil-related mechanisms in progression to ARDS.},

The Nigro\textendash{}Neostriatal neurons perform both the motor and mental functions. Their degeneration causes hypokinesia and rigidity while overstimulation of neostriatal dopamine (DA) receptors causes stereotyped behavior. The tubro-infundibular DA neurons probably act by way of inhibiting the release of luteinizing hormone releasing factor (LHRF) from the median eminence. The central noradrenaline (NA) neurons perform various functions, such as function in wakefulness, emotion, behavior, neuroendocrine function, and function in reflex activity. The central 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons contribute to the function in mood, wakefulness, thought process, behavior, neuroendocrine function, and function in reflex activity. The NA neurons probably are essential for conditioned processes as are the DA neurons while a destruction of the 5-HT neurons results in insomnia. Increased NA receptor activity results in aggression. The descending bulbospinal 5-HT neurons participate in the control of autonomic and somatic reflex activity, especially in the lumbosacral part.},

To explore synaptic signaling of cholinergic forebrain neurons, we activated choline acetyltransferase expressing neurons using channelrhodopsin while recording post-synaptic currents (PSCs) in layer 1 interneurons. Surprisingly, we observed PSCs mediated by GABAA receptors in addition to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Based on PSC latency and pharmacological sensitivity, our results suggest monosynaptic release of both GABA and ACh. Anatomical analysis showed that forebrain cholinergic neurons express the GABA synthetic enzyme Gad2 and the vesicular GABA transporter (Slc32a1). We confirmed the direct release of GABA by knocking out Slc32a1 from cholinergic neurons. Our results identify GABA as an overlooked fast neurotransmitter utilized throughout the forebrain cholinergic system. GABA/ACh corelease may have major implications for modulation of cortical function by cholinergic neurons.},

  doi = {10.1089/neu.2015.4037},
  abstract = {Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) cells are widely distributed in the spinal cord and their functions are largely unknown. We have previously found that AADC cells in the spinal cord could increase their ability to produce serotonin from 5-hydroxytryptophan after spinal cord injury (SCI). Since AADC is a common enzyme catalyzing 5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin and L-dopa to dopamine (DA), it seems likely that the ability of AADC cells using L-dopa to synthesize DA is also increased. To prove whether this is the case a same rat sacral SCI model and a similar experimental paradigm were adopted as we used previously (Wienecke et al., J. Neurosci. 34, 11984, 2014). In the chronic SCI rats (\ensuremath{>} 45d), no AADC cells expressed DA if there was no exogenous L-dopa application. However, following administration of a peripheral AADC inhibitor (carbidopa) with or without a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (pargyline) co-application, systemic administration of L-dopa resulted in \textasciitilde{} 94\% of AADC cells to become DA-immunopositive in the spinal cord below the lesion, whereas in normal or sham-operated rats none or very few of AADC cells became DA-immunopositive with the same treatment. Using tail electromyography, spontaneous tail muscle activity was increased nearly 5-fold over the baseline level. When pretreated with a central AADC inhibitor (NSD1015), further application of L-dopa failed to increase the motoneuron activity although the expression of DA in the AADC cells was not completely inhibited. These findings demonstrate that AADC cells in the spinal cord below the lesion gain the ability to produce DA from its precursor in response to SCI. This ability also enables the AADC cells to produce 5-HT and trace-amines, and likely contributes to the development of hyperexcitability. These results might also be implicated for revealing the pathological mechanisms underlying L-dopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {The specific function of microglia, the tissue resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord, has been difficult to ascertain because of a lack of tools to distinguish microglia from other immune cells, thereby limiting specific immunostaining, purification, and manipulation. Because of their unique developmental origins and predicted functions, the distinction of microglia from other myeloid cells is critically important for understanding brain development and disease; better tools would greatly facilitate studies of microglia function in the developing, adult, and injured CNS. Here, we identify transmembrane protein 119 (Tmem119), a cell-surface protein of unknown function, as a highly expressed microglia-specific marker in both mouse and human. We developed monoclonal antibodies to its intracellular and extracellular domains that enable the immunostaining of microglia in histological sections in healthy and diseased brains, as well as isolation of pure nonactivated microglia by FACS. Using our antibodies, we provide, to our knowledge, the first RNAseq profiles of highly pure mouse microglia during development and after an immune challenge. We used these to demonstrate that mouse microglia mature by the second postnatal week and to predict novel microglial functions. Together, we anticipate these resources will be valuable for the future study and understanding of microglia in health and disease.},

  abstract = {Gene profiling techniques allow the assay of transcripts from organs, tissues, and cells with an unprecedented level of coverage. However, most of these approaches are still limited by the fact that organs and tissues are composed of multiple cell types that are each unique in their patterns of gene expression. To identify the transcriptome from a single cell type in a complex tissue, investigators have relied upon physical methods to separate cell types or in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Here, we describe a strategy to rapidly and efficiently isolate ribosome-associated mRNA transcripts from any cell type in vivo. We have created a mouse line, called RiboTag, which carries an Rpl22 allele with a floxed wild-type C-terminal exon followed by an identical C-terminal exon that has three copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope inserted before the stop codon. When the RiboTag mouse is crossed to a cell-type-specific Cre recombinase-expressing mouse, Cre recombinase activates the expression of epitope-tagged ribosomal protein RPL22ha, which is incorporated into actively translating polyribosomes. Immunoprecipitation of polysomes with a monoclonal antibody against HA yields ribosome-associated mRNA transcripts from specific cell types. We demonstrate the application of this technique in brain using neuron-specific Cre recombinase-expressing mice and in testis using a Sertoli cell Cre recombinase-expressing mouse.},

  abstract = {Motivation: In the Affymetrix GeneChip system, preprocessing occurs before one obtains expression level measurements. Because the number of competing preprocessing methods was large and growing we developed a benchmark to help users identify the best method for their application. A webtool was made available for developers to benchmark their procedures. At the time of writing over 50 methods had been submitted.
Results: We benchmarked 31 probe set algorithms using a U95A dataset of spike in controls. Using this dataset, we found that background correction, one of the main steps in preprocessing, has the largest effect on performance. In particular, background correction appears to improve accuracy but, in general, worsen precision. The benchmark results put this balance in perspective. Furthermore, we have improved some of the original benchmark metrics to provide more detailed information regarding precision and accuracy. A handful of methods stand out as providing the best balance using spike-in data with the older U95A array, although different experiments on more current arrays may benchmark differently.

  abstract = {Oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria is responsible for 90\% of ATP synthesis in most cells. This essential housekeeping function is mediated by nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding subunits of complex I to V of the respiratory chain. Although complex IV is the best studied of these complexes, the exact function of the striated muscle-specific subunit COX6A2 is still poorly understood. In this study, we show that Cox6a2-deficient mice are protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. This phenotype results from elevated energy expenditure and a skeletal muscle fiber type switch towards more oxidative fibers. At the molecular level we observe increased formation of reactive oxygen species, constitutive activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, and enhanced expression of uncoupling proteins. Our data indicate that COX6A2 is a regulator of respiratory uncoupling in muscle and we demonstrate that a novel and direct link exists between muscle respiratory chain activity and diet-induced obesity/insulin resistance.},

However, cells in culture may behave differently from cells in vivo in many ways. One of these is that cell culture imposes a state of oxidative stress on cells. I argue that cells that survive and grow in culture might use ROS-dependent signal transduction pathways that rarely or never operate in vivo. A further problem is that cell culture media can catalyse the oxidation of compounds added to them, resulting in apparent cellular effects that are in fact due to oxidation products such as ROS. Such artefacts may have affected many studies on the effects of ascorbate, thiols, flavonoids and other polyphenolic compounds on cells in culture.},

  abstract = {An important goal in neuroscience is to understand gene expression patterns in the brain. The recent availability of comprehensive and detailed expression atlases for mouse and human creates opportunities to discover global patterns and perform cross-species comparisons. Recently we reported that the major source of variation in gene transcript expression in the adult normal mouse brain can be parsimoniously explained as reflecting regional variation in glia to neuron ratios, and is correlated with degree of connectivity and location in the brain along the anterior-posterior axis. Here we extend this investigation to two gene expression assays of adult normal human brains that consisted of over 300 brain region samples, and perform comparative analyses of brain-wide expression patterns to the mouse. We performed principal components analysis (PCA) on the regional gene expression of the adult human brain to identify the expression pattern that has the largest variance. As in the mouse, we observed that the first principal component is composed of two anti-correlated patterns enriched in oligodendrocyte and neuron markers respectively. However, we also observed interesting discordant patterns between the two species. For example, a few mouse neuron markers show expression patterns that are more correlated with the human oligodendrocyte-enriched pattern and vice-versa. In conclusion, our work provides insights into human brain function and evolution by probing global relationships between regional cell type marker expression patterns in the human and mouse brain.},

factors mediating the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) utilizing a
variety of biochemical and neuroendocrine strategies. Indeed, assessments
of cerebrospinal fluid chemistry, neuroendocrine responses to pharmacological
challenge, and neuroreceptor and transporter binding have demonstrated a number
of abnormalities in the amine neurotransmitter systems in this disorder. However,
recent studies have also implicated critical signal transduction pathways
as being integral to the pathophysiology and treatment of BD, in addition
to a growing body of data suggesting that impairments of neuroplasticity and
cellular resilience may also underlie the pathophysiology of the disorder.
It is thus noteworthy that mood stabilizers and antidepressants indirectly
regulate a number of factors involved in cell survival pathways - including
MAP kinases, CREB, BDNF and bcl-2 protein - and may thus bring about some
of their delayed long-term beneficial effects via underappreciated neurotrophic
effects.},

Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations.
RESULTS: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.
AVAILABILITY: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

  abstract = {Studies of bipolar disorder (BD) suggest a genetic basis of the illness that alters brain function and morphology. In recent years, a number of genetic variants associated with BD have been identified. However, little is known about the associated genes, or brain circuits that rely upon their function. Using an anatomically comprehensive survey of the human transcriptome (The Allen Brain Atlas), we mapped the expression of 58 genes with suspected involvement in BD based upon their relationship to SNPs identified in genome wide association studies (GWAS). We then conducted a meta-analysis of structural MRI studies to identify brain regions that are abnormal in BD. Of 58 BD associated genes, 22 had anatomically distinct expression patterns that could be categorized into one of three clusters (C1\textendash{}C3). Brain regions with the highest and lowest expression of these genes did not overlap strongly with anatomical sites identified as abnormal by structural MRI except in the parahippocampal gyrus, the inferior/superior temporal gyrus and the cerebellar vermis, regions where overlap was significant. Using the 22 genes in C1\textendash{}C3 as reference points, additional genes with correlated expression patterns were identified and organized into sets based on similarity. Further analysis revealed that five of these gene sets were significantly associated with BD, suggesting that anatomical expression profile is correlated with genetic susceptibility to BD, particularly for genes in C2. Our data suggest that expression profiles of BD-associated genes do not explain the majority of structural abnormalities observed in BD, but may be useful in identifying new candidate genes. Our results highlight the complex neuroanatomical basis of BD, and reinforce illness models that emphasize impaired brain connectivity.},

Conditional knockout and overexpression of G9a within these distinct cell types, however, revealed divergent behavioral phenotypes in response to repeated cocaine treatment. Our studies further indicated that such developmental deletion of G9a selectively in Drd2 neurons resulted in the unsilencing of transcriptional programs normally specific to striatonigral neurons and in the acquisition of Drd1-associated projection and electrophysiological properties. This partial striatopallidal to striatonigral 'switching' phenotype in mice indicates a new role for G9a in contributing to neuronal subtype identity and suggests a critical function for cell type\textendash{}specific histone methylation patterns in the regulation of behavioral responses to environmental stimuli.},

  abstract = {The availability of an accessible tissue whose gene expression profile is similar to more inaccessible CNS tissues has the potential to advance research in neuropsychiatric disorders. We conducted secondary data analysis of transcriptional profiling of 79 human tissues for 33,698 genes using the Affymetrix U133A microarray augmented with a custom microarray (Affymetrix GNF1H), which were produced by the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (http://symatlas.gnf.org). Our analyses suggested that: (a) on a transcriptome level, whole blood shares significant gene expression similarities with multiple CNS tissues; (b) the median non-parametric correlation between transcripts present in both whole blood and CNS was around 0.5; (c) this correlation of 0.5 was intermediate relative to all tissues in the Novartis data set\textemdash{}less than for the maximum achievable value of 0.85, less than a set of immune tissues (0.64), comparable to a heterogeneous set of somatic tissues (0.57) but greater than muscle (0.48) and peripheral nervous system tissues (0.36); (d) about half of a set of candidate genes relevant to schizophrenia were expressed in both whole blood and prefrontal cortex; and (e) the expression levels of many classes of biologically relevant processes were not significantly different between whole blood and prefrontal cortex. These analyses suggest that gene expression in whole blood is neither perfectly correlated and useful nor perfectly uncorrelated and useless with gene expression in multiple brain tissues. This suggests that the cautious and thoughtful use of peripheral gene expression may be a useful surrogate for gene expression in the CNS when it has been determined that the relevant gene is expressed in both. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Conventional approaches to classifying cell types in the human brain at single cell resolution have been limited to exploring relatively few markers and therefore have provided a limited molecular characterization of any given cell type. We used single cell RNA sequencing on 466 cells to capture the cellular complexity of the adult and fetal human brain at a whole transcriptome level. Healthy adult temporal lobe tissue was obtained during surgical procedures where otherwise normal tissue was removed to gain access to deeper hippocampal pathology in patients with medical refractory seizures. We were able to classify individual cells into all of the major neuronal, glial, and vascular cell types in the brain. We were able to divide neurons into individual communities and show that these communities preserve the categorization of interneuron subtypes that is typically observed with the use of classic interneuron markers. We then used single cell RNA sequencing on fetal human cortical neurons to identify genes that are differentially expressed between fetal and adult neurons and those genes that display an expression gradient that reflects the transition between replicating and quiescent fetal neuronal populations. Finally, we observed the expression of major histocompatibility complex type I genes in a subset of adult neurons, but not fetal neurons. The work presented here demonstrates the applicability of single cell RNA sequencing on the study of the adult human brain and constitutes a first step toward a comprehensive cellular atlas of the human brain.},

The absence of these neurons causes narcolepsy in humans and model organisms. However, little is known about the molecular phenotype of these cells; previous attempts at comprehensive profiling had only limited sensitivity or were inaccurate. We generated a Hcrt translating ribosome affinity purification (bacTRAP) line for comprehensive translational profiling of all ribosome-bound transcripts in these neurons in vivo. From this profile, we identified \ensuremath{>}6000 transcripts detectably expressed above background and 188 transcripts that are highly enriched in these neurons, including all known markers of the cells. Blinded analysis of in situ hybridization databases suggests that \ensuremath{\sim}60\% of these are expressed in a Hcrt marker-like pattern. Fifteen of these were confirmed with double labeling and microscopy, including the transcription factor Lhx9. Ablation of this gene results in a \ensuremath{>}30\% loss specifically of Hcrt neurons, without a general disruption of hypothalamic development. Polysomnography and activity monitoring revealed a profound hypersomnolence in these mice. These data provide an in-depth and accurate profile of Hcrt neuron gene expression and suggest that Lhx9 may be important for specification or survival of a subset of these cells.},

In addition, the connections of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortical areas were re-examined in the monkey. The present analysis showed that only a restricted portion of what had previously been labelled as area 46 in the monkey has the same characteristics as area 46 of the human brain; the remaining part of this monkey region has the characteristics of a portion of the middle frontal gyrus in the human brain that had previously been included as part of area 9. We have labelled this cortical area as 9/46 in both species. These two areas (i.e. 46 and 9/46), which constitute the lower half of the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex, have a well-developed granular layer IV, and can easily be distinguished from area 9, on the upper part of the mid-dorsolateral region, which does not have a well-developed granular layer IV. Area 9 has the same basic pattern of connections as areas 46 and 9/46, but, unlike the latter areas, it does not receive input from the lateral parietal cortex. Caudal to area 9, on the dorsomedial portion of the frontal cortex, there is a distinct strip of cortex (area 8B) which, unlike area 9, receives significant input from the prestriate cortex and the medial parietal cortex. The present results provide a basis for a closer integration of findings from functional neuroimaging studies in human subjects with experimental work in the monkey.},

An essential question that arises from these data is how to identify those genes that are enriched in each cell type relative to all others. Genes relatively specifically employed by a cell type may contribute to the unique functions of that cell, and thus may become useful targets for development of pharmacological tools for cell-specific manipulations. We describe here a novel statistic, the specificity index, which can be used for comparative quantitative analysis to identify genes enriched in specific cell populations across a large number of profiles. This measure correctly predicts in situ hybridization patterns for many cell types. We apply this measure to a large survey of CNS cell-specific microarray data to identify those genes that are significantly enriched in each population Data and algorithms are available online (www.bactrap.org).},

As endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs) are implicated in other aspects of neurobiological programming, this study aimed to characterize the effects of perinatal GC exposure on the cytoarchitecture of DA populations in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Dexamethasone was administered non-invasively to rat pups via the mothers' drinking water during embryonic days 16\textendash{}19 or postnatal days 1\textendash{}7, with a total oral intake circa 0.075 or 0.15 mg/kg/day, respectively; controls received normal drinking water. Analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cell counts and regional volumes in adult offspring identified notable sex differences in the shape and volume of the SNc and VTA, as well as the topographical organization and size of the DA populations. Perinatal GC treatments increased the DA population size and altered the shape of the SNc and VTA as well as the organization of the DA neurons by expanding and/or shifting them in a caudal direction. This response was sexually dimorphic and included a feminization or demasculinization of the three-dimensional cytoarchitecture in males, and subtle differences that were dependent on the window of exposure. These findings demonstrate that inappropriate perinatal exposure to GCs have enduring effects on the organization of midbrain DA systems that are critically important for normal brain function throughout life.},

Three-way analysis of variance of microarray data from frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus was performed with the presence/absence of AD and vascular dementia, and sex, as factors. Comparative analyses of expression changes in the brains of AD patients and a mouse model of AD were also performed. Relevant changes in gene expression identified by microarray analysis were validated by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The hippocampi of AD brains showed the most significant alteration in gene expression profile. Genes involved in noninsulin-dependent DM and obesity were significantly altered in both AD brains and the AD mouse model, as were genes related to psychiatric disorders and AD. The alterations in the expression profiles of DM-related genes in AD brains were independent of peripheral DM-related abnormalities. These results indicate that altered expression of genes related to DM in AD brains is a result of AD pathology, which may thereby be exacerbated by peripheral insulin resistance or DM.},

  abstract = {Determining the molecular mechanism(s) leading to Purkinje neuron loss in the neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is limited by the complex morphology of this cell type. Purkinje neurons are notoriously difficult to isolate and maintain in culture presenting considerable difficultly to identify molecular changes in response to expanded CGG repeat (rCGG)-containing mRNA that induces neurotoxicity in FXTAS. Several studies have uncovered a number of RNA-binding proteins involved in translation that aberrantly interact with the CGG-containing RNA; however, whether these interactions alter the translational profile of cells has not been investigated. Here we employ bacTRAP translational profiling to demonstrate that Purkinje neurons ectopically expressing 90 CGG repeats exhibit a dramatic change in their translational profile even prior to the onset of rCGG-induced phenotypes. This approach identified \ensuremath{\sim}500 transcripts that are differentially associated with ribosomes in r(CGG)90-expressing mice. Functional annotation cluster analysis revealed broad ontologies enriched in the r(CGG)90 list, including RNA binding and response to stress. Intriguingly, a transcript for the Tardbp gene, implicated in a number of other neurodegenerative disorders, exhibits altered association with ribosomes in the presence of r(CGG)90 repeats. We therefore tested and showed that reduced association of Tardbp mRNA with the ribosomes results in a loss of TDP-43 protein expression in r(CGG)90-expressing Purkinje neurons. Furthermore, we showed that TDP-43 could modulate the rCGG repeat-mediated toxicity in a Drosophila model that we developed previously. These findings together suggest that translational dysregulation may be an underlying mechanism of rCGG-induced neurotoxicity in FXTAS.},

METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 40 cases of AAA including 33 cases of non-severe aplastic anemia(NSAA), 7 cases of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and 20 subjects as control group were collected to detect mRNA expression of TERT and TIN2 by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR), the correlation of TERT and TIN2 mRNA expression levels with classification of peripheral blood cells were analyzed.
RESULTS: The expression levels of TERT and TIN2 mRNA in patients with AAA were lower significantly than those in control group (P \ensuremath{<} 0.05), and the SAA (P \ensuremath{<} 0.01). The expression levels of TERT and TIN2 mRNA in patients with SAA were all lower significantly than those in patients with NSAA (P \ensuremath{<} 0.05). The expression levels of TIN2 mRNA in patients with NSAA were lower significantly than those in control group (P \ensuremath{<} 0.01). There were no significant difference in the expression level of TERT mRNA between patients with NSAA and control group (P = 0.082). There was significant correlation between the expression level of TERT mRNA and red blood cells count (r = 0.437, P = 0.029), and hemoglobin level (r = 0.522, P = 0.007). There was significant correlation between the expression levels of TIN2 mRNA and the lymphocyte percentage (r = -0.404, P = 0.045).
CONCLUSION: The expression level of TERT mRNA may be associated with the red blood cells and hemoglobin level. The expression level of TIN2 mRNA may be associated with the lymphocyte percentage.},

In the 1970s and 1980s, vestibulo-ocular reflex adaptation, adaptive locomotion, eye blink conditioning, and learning in hand/arm movement were established as effective experimental paradigms for investigating neural mechanisms of cerebellar functions. In the 1980s, long-term depression (LTD) was discovered and considered as a memory process in the cerebellum; in the 1990s, complex signal transduction processes underlying LTD were revealed. It was also in the 1980s that computational approaches were advanced for modeling control system functions of the cerebellum. Currently, there are two alternative models proposed for VOR adaptation. In this decade, we envisage new developments toward the fusion of knowledge of the cerebellum at molecular and cellular levels and those in systems and computation. Studies of LTD will play a key role in pursuing this direction.},

An additional 94 transcripts demonstrated significant seasonal variability that was largely influenced by blood cell count levels. These transcripts were enriched for immune function, protein production, and specific cellular markers for lymphocytes. Accordingly, cell counts for erythrocytes, platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, and CD19 cells demonstrated significant association with a 12-month seasonal cycle. These results demonstrate that seasonal variation is an important environmental regulator of gene expression and blood cell composition. Notable changes in leukocyte counts and genes involved in immune function indicate that immune cell physiology varies throughout the year in healthy individuals.},

Microglia are ontogenetically and functionally distinct from monocyte-derived macrophages that infiltrate the CNS under pathological conditions. However, a lack of specific markers that distinguish resident microglia from circulating blood-derived macrophages in human brain tissues hampers accurate evaluation of microglial contributions to the human brain pathology. By comparative analysis of five comprehensive microglial transcriptome datasets, we identified an evolutionarily conserved protein TMEM119 as the most promising candidate for human microglial markers. TMEM119 was expressed on immortalized human microglia, in which the expression levels were not elevated by exposure to lipopolysaccharide, IFN\ensuremath{\gamma}, IL-4, IL-13 or TGF\ensuremath{\beta}1. Notably, TMEM119 immunoreactivity was expressed exclusively on a subset of Iba1(+) CD68(+) microglia with ramified and amoeboid morphologies in the brains of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas Iba1(+) CD68(+) infiltrating macrophages do not express TMEM119 in demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis and necrotic lesions of cerebral infarction. TMEM119 mRNA levels were elevated in AD brains, although the protein levels were not significantly different between AD and non-AD cases by western blot and morphometric analyses. TMEM119-positive microglia did not consistently express polarized markers for M1 (CD80) or M2 (CD163, CD209) in AD brains. These results suggest that TMEM119 serves as a reliable microglial marker that discriminates resident microglia from blood-derived macrophages in the human brain.},

  abstract = {Background
This study aims to characterize the housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in 15 mouse tissues by using the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) strategy which indicates the relative level of expression for each transcript matched to the tag.

Results
Here, we identified constantly expressed housekeeping genes, such as eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2, which is expressed in all tissues without significant difference in expression levels. Moreover, most of these genes were not regulated by experimental conditions such as steroid hormones, adrenalectomy and gonadectomy. In addition, we report previously postulated housekeeping genes such as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and beta-actin, which are expressed in all the tissues, but with significant difference in their expression levels. We have also identified genes uniquely detected in each of the 15 tissues and other tissues from public databases.

Conclusion
These identified housekeeping genes could represent appropriate controls for RT-PCR and northern blot when comparing the expression levels of genes in several tissues. The results reveal several tissue-specific genes highly expressed in testis and pituitary gland. Furthermore, the main function of tissue-specific genes expressed in liver, lung and bone is the cell defence, whereas several keratins involved in cell structure function are exclusively detected in skin and vagina. The results from this study can be used for example to target a tissue for agent delivering by using the promoter of tissue-specific genes. Moreover, this study could be used as basis for further researches on physiology and pathology of these tissues.},

Just as with any new field, several models of screening are being explored, and innovators are working on the most efficient methods to overcome the inherent limitations of primary cell screens using iPSCs. In the present review, we provide a background regarding why iPSCs represent a paradigm shift for central nervous system (CNS) disease modeling. We describe the efforts in the field to develop more biologically relevant CNS disease models, which should provide screening assays useful for the pharmaceutical industry. We also provide some examples of successful uses for iPSC-based screens and suggest that additional development could revolutionize the field of drug discovery. The development and implementation of these advanced iPSC-based screens will create a more efficient disease-specific process underpinned by the biological mechanism in a patient- and disease-specific manner rather than by trial-and-error. Moreover, with careful and strategic planning, shared resources can be developed that will enable exponential advances in the field. This will undoubtedly lead to more sensitive and accurate screens for early diagnosis and allow the identification of patient-specific therapies, thus, paving the way to personalized medicine.},

Here, we evaluate two different types of microarray analyses: (i) the same gene in replicate samples and (ii) different, but co-expressed genes in the same sample. The reliability of the latter analysis needs to be determined for the analysis of regulatory networks and our report is the first attempt to evaluate for the accuracy of different microarray normalization methods in this respect. Consistent with previous results we observed a large effect of the normalization method on the outcome of the expression analyses. Our analyses indicate that different normalization methods should be performed depending on whether a study is aiming to detect differential gene expression between independent samples or whether co-expressed genes should be identified.

Using cluster analysis, we observed a significant alteration in the expression pattern of 81 genes (P\ensuremath{<}0.001) in the PBMCs of RA patients compared with controls. Many of these genes correlated with differences in monocyte counts between the two study populations, and we show that a large fraction of these genes are specifically expressed at high levels in monocytes. In addition, a logistic regression analysis was performed to identify genes that performed best in the categorization of RA and control samples. Glutaminyl cyclase, IL1RA, S100A12 (also known as calgranulin or EN-RAGE) and Grb2-associated binding protein (GAB2) were among the top discriminators. Along with previous data, the overexpression of S100A12 in RA patients emphasizes the likely importance of RAGE pathways in disease pathogenesis. The altered expression of GAB2, an intracellular adaptor molecule involved in regulating phosphatase function, is of particular interest given the recent identification of the intracellular phosphatase PTPN22 as a risk gene for RA. These data suggest that a detailed study of gene expression patterns in peripheral blood can provide insight into disease pathogenesis. However, it is also clear that substantially larger sample sizes will be required in order to evaluate fully gene expression profiling as a means of identifying disease subsets, or defining biomarkers of outcome and response to therapy in RA.},

Immunohistochemistry for phenotypic markers, followed by unbiased stereology is often used to quantify the relevant neuronal population. To control for loss of phenotypic markers in the absence of cell death, or to determine if other types of neurons are lost, a general neuronal marker is often desired. Vertebrate neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) is reportedly expressed in most mammalian neurons. In Parkinson's disease models, NeuN has been widely used to determine if there is actual nigral dopamine neuron loss or simply loss of tyrosine hydroxylase expression, a prominent phenotypic marker. To date, the qualitative value of NeuN expression as such a marker in the substantia nigra has not been assessed. Midbrain tissue sections from control rats were stained for NeuN and tyrosine hydroxylase and assessed by light or confocal microscopy. Here we report that NeuN expression level in the rat substantia nigra was highly variable, with many faintly stained cells that would not be meet stereological scoring criteria. Additionally, dopamine neurons with little or no NeuN expression were readily identified. Subcellular compartmentalization of NeuN expression was also variable, with many cells dorsal and ventral to the nigra exhibiting expression in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. NeuN expression also appeared to be much higher in non-dopamine neurons within the ventral midbrain. This characterization of nigral NeuN expression suggests that it is not useful as a quantitative general neuronal marker in the substantia nigra.},

RMA performs background correction, normalization, and summarization in a modular way. The last 2 steps require multiple arrays to be analyzed simultaneously. The ability to borrow information across samples provides RMA various advantages. For example, the summarization step fits a parametric model that accounts for probe effects, assumed to be fixed across arrays, and improves outlier detection. Residuals, obtained from the fitted model, permit the creation of useful quality metrics. However, the dependence on multiple arrays has 2 drawbacks: (1) RMA cannot be used in clinical settings where samples must be processed individually or in small batches and (2) data sets preprocessed separately are not comparable. We propose a preprocessing algorithm, frozen RMA (fRMA), which allows one to analyze microarrays individually or in small batches and then combine the data for analysis. This is accomplished by utilizing information from the large publicly available microarray databases. In particular, estimates of probe-specific effects and variances are precomputed and frozen. Then, with new data sets, these are used in concert with information from the new arrays to normalize and summarize the data. We find that fRMA is comparable to RMA when the data are analyzed as a single batch and outperforms RMA when analyzing multiple batches. The methods described here are implemented in the R package fRMA and are currently available for download from the software section of http://rafalab.jhsph.edu.},

Until now, limitations in the ability to enrich adult NSCs (aNSCs) have hampered meaningful analysis of these cells at the transcriptome level. Here we show via a split-Cre technology that coincident activity of the hGFAP and prominin1 promoters is a hallmark of aNSCs in~vivo. Sorting of cells from the adult mouse subependymal zone (SEZ) based on their expression of GFAP and prominin1 isolates all self-renewing, multipotent stem cells at high purity. Comparison of the transcriptome of these purified aNSCs to parenchymal nonneurogenic astrocytes and other SEZ cells reveals aNSC hallmarks, including neuronal lineage priming and the importance of cilia- and Ca-dependent signaling pathways. Inducible deletion of the ciliary protein IFT88 in aNSCs validates the role of ciliary function in aNSCs. Our work reveals candidate molecular regulators for unique features of aNSCs and facilitates future selective analysis of aNSCs in other functional contexts, such as aging and injury.},

  abstract = {This review provides an overview of the interaction between the mammalian cholinergic system and circadian system, and its possible role in time memory. Several studies made clear that circadian (daily) fluctuations in acetylcholine (ACh) release, cholinergic enzyme activity and cholinergic receptor expression varies remarkably between species and even strains. Apparently, cholinergic features can be flexibly adjusted to the needs of a species or strain. Nevertheless, it can be generalized that circadian rhythmicity in the cholinergic system is characterized by high ACh release during the active phase of an individual. During the active phase, the activity of the ACh synthesizing enzyme Choline Acetyltransferase (ChAT) is enhanced, and the activity of the ACh degrading enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is reduced. The number of free, unbound and thus available muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) is highest when ACh release is lowest. The cholinergic innervation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the hypothalamic circadian master clock, arises from the cholinergic forebrain and brain stem nuclei. The density of cholinergic fibers and terminals is modest as compared to other hypothalamic nuclei. This is the case for rat, hamster and mouse, three chronobiological model rodent species studied by us. A new finding is that the rat SCN contains some local cholinergic neurons. Hamster SCN contains less cholinergic neurons, whereas the mouse SCN is devoid of such cells. ACh has an excitatory effect on SCN cells (at least in vivo), and functions in close interaction with other neurotransmitters. Originally it was thought that ACh transferred retinal light information to the SCN. This turned out to be wrong. Thereafter, the phase shifting effects of ACh prompted researches to view ACh as an agent for nocturnal clock resetting. It is still not clear, however, what the function consequence is of SCN cholinergic neurotransmission. Here, we postulate the hypothesis that cholinergic neurotransmission in the SCN provides the brain with a mechanism to support the formation of time memory via `time stamping'. We define time memory as the memory of a specific time of the day, for which an animal made an association with a certain event and/or location (for example in case of time-place association). We use the term `time stamping' to refer to the process underlying the encoding of a specific time of day (the time stamp). Only relatively brief but arousing events seem to be time stamped at SCN level. This time stamping requires the engagement of mAChRs. New data suggests that the SCN uses the neuropeptide vasopressin (AVP) as an output system to transfer the specific time of day information to other brain regions such as hippocampus and neocortex where time memory is supposed to be acquired, consolidated and stored. Since time stamping is a cholinergically mediated function of the circadian system, the early disruption of the cholinergic and circadian systems as seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may contribute to the cognitive disruption of temporal organization of memory and behavior in these patients.},

  abstract = {The tumour load of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvests and the outcome of ex vivo immunomagnetic B-cell purging was investigated in 19 patients with low-grade lymphoma. To quantify the tumour load, we combined fluorescence-activated cell sorting measurement of CD19+ B-cells and determination of the B-cell light chain ratio (LCR) with consensus complementarity-determining region III-polymerase chain reaction (CDRIII-PCR) and gene scan analysis. The number of tumour cells was calculated using B-cell extracts from the PBSCs. Two different patterns were distinguished. In eight patients (42\%) with CD19+ B cells \ensuremath{>}1\% in the apheresis product, a high tumour load was found, characterized by a monoclonal LCR, positive PCR in seven out of eight cases, \ensuremath{>}5 x 10(7) extracted lymphoma cells in six out of seven PCR-assessable cases, and the presence of residual lymphoma after purging in six of seven cases. In 11 patients (58\%) with \ensuremath{<}1\% CD19+ B-cells in the product, a low tumour load was indicated by a polyclonal LCR, positive PCR in only 4 out of 11 cases, \ensuremath{>}5 x 10(7) extracted lymphoma cells in zero out of four PCR-assessable cases, and the presence of residual lymphoma after purging in zero out of four of these cases. The level of residual lymphoma following purging largely depended on the level of tumour contamination. CD19+ B-cells \ensuremath{>}50/microl in the peripheral blood at mobilization predicted a high tumour load in the apheresis product.},

In two transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease (5xFAD and 3xTg-AD mice), neutrophils extravasated and were present in areas with amyloid-\ensuremath{\beta} (A\ensuremath{\beta}) deposits, where they released neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and IL-17. A\ensuremath{\beta}42 peptide triggered the LFA-1 integrin high-affinity state and rapid neutrophil adhesion to integrin ligands. In vivo, LFA-1 integrin controlled neutrophil extravasation into the CNS and intraparenchymal motility. In transgenic Alzheimer's disease models, neutrophil depletion or inhibition of neutrophil trafficking via LFA-1 blockade reduced Alzheimer's disease\textendash{}like neuropathology and improved memory in mice already showing cognitive dysfunction. Temporary depletion of neutrophils for 1 month at early stages of disease led to sustained improvements in memory. Transgenic Alzheimer's disease model mice lacking LFA-1 were protected from cognitive decline and had reduced gliosis. In humans with Alzheimer's disease, neutrophils adhered to and spread inside brain venules and were present in the parenchyma, along with NETs. Our results demonstrate that neutrophils contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and cognitive impairment and suggest that the inhibition of neutrophil trafficking may be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {The molecular architecture of developing serotonin (5HT) neurons is poorly understood, yet its determination is likely to be essential for elucidating functional heterogeneity of these cells and the contribution of serotonergic dysfunction to disease pathogenesis. Here, we describe the purification of postmitotic embryonic 5HT neurons by flow cytometry for whole-genome microarray expression profiling of this unitary monoaminergic neuron type. Our studies identified significantly enriched expression of hundreds of unique genes in 5HT neurons, thus providing an abundance of new serotonergic markers. Furthermore, we identified several hundred transcripts encoding homeodomain, axon guidance, cell adhesion, intracellular signaling, ion transport, and imprinted genes associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders that were differentially enriched in developing rostral and caudal 5HT neurons. These findings suggested a homeodomain code that distinguishes rostral and caudal 5HT neurons. Indeed, verification studies demonstrated that Hmx homeodomain and Hox gene expression defined an Hmx+ rostral subtype and Hox+ caudal subtype. Expression of engrailed genes in a subset of 5HT neurons in the rostral domain further distinguished two subtypes defined as Hmx+En+ and Hmx+En-. The differential enrichment of gene sets for different canonical pathways and gene ontology categories provided additional evidence for heterogeneity between rostral and caudal 5HT neurons. These findings demonstrate a deep transcriptome and biological pathway duality for neurons that give rise to the ascending and descending serotonergic subsystems. Our databases provide a rich, clinically relevant resource for definition of 5HT neuron subtypes and elucidation of the genetic networks required for serotonergic function.},

Antigen-presenting cells in the disease-free brain have been identified primarily by expression of antigens such as CD11b, CD11c, and MHC II, which can be shared by dendritic cells (DCs), microglia, and monocytes. In this study, starting with the criterion of Flt3 (FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3)-dependent development, we characterize the features of authentic DCs within the meninges and choroid plexus in healthy mouse brains. Analyses of morphology, gene expression, and antigen-presenting function established a close relationship between meningeal and choroid plexus DCs (m/chDCs) and spleen DCs. DCs in both sites shared an intrinsic requirement for Flt3 ligand. Microarrays revealed differences in expression of transcripts encoding surface molecules, transcription factors, pattern recognition receptors, and other genes in m/chDCs compared with monocytes and microglia. Migrating pre-DC progenitors from bone marrow gave rise to m/chDCs that had a 5\textendash{}7-d half-life. In contrast to microglia, DCs actively present self-antigens and stimulate T cells. Therefore, the meninges and choroid plexus of a steady-state brain contain DCs that derive from local precursors and exhibit a differentiation and antigen-presenting program similar to spleen DCs and distinct from microglia.},

  abstract = {To evaluate the utility of transcript profiling for prediction of protein expression levels, we compared profiles across the NCI-60 cancer cell panel, which represents nine tissues of origin. For that analysis, we present here two new NCI-60 transcript profile data sets (A based on Affymetrix HG-U95 and HG-U133A chips; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and one new protein profile data set (based on reverse-phase protein lysate arrays). The data sets are available online at http://discover.nci.nih.gov in the CellMiner program package. Using the new transcript data in combination with our previously published cDNA array and Affymetrix HU6800 data sets, we first developed a ``consensus set'' of transcript profiles based on the four different microarray platforms. Using that set, we found that 65\% of the genes showed statistically significant transcript-protein correlation, and the correlations were generally higher than those reported previously for panels of mammalian cells. Using the predictive analysis of microarray nearest shrunken centroid algorithm for functional prediction of tissue of origin, we then found that (a) the consensus mRNA set did better than did data from any of the individual mRNA platforms and (b) the protein data seemed to do somewhat better (P = 0.027) on a gene-for-gene basis in this particular study than did the consensus mRNA data, but both did well. Analysis based on the Gene Ontology showed protein levels of structure-related genes to be well predicted by mRNA levels (mean r = 0.71). Because the transcript-based technologies are more mature and are currently able to assess larger numbers of genes at one time, they continue to be useful, even when the ultimate aim is information about proteins.

  abstract = {To respond to potential adverse exposures properly, health care providers need accurate indicators of exposure levels. The indicators are particularly important in the case of acetaminophen (APAP) intoxication, the leading cause of liver failure in the U.S. We hypothesized that gene expression patterns derived from blood cells would provide useful indicators of acute exposure levels. To test this hypothesis, we used a blood gene expression data set from rats exposed to APAP to train classifiers in two prediction algorithms and to extract patterns for prediction using a profiling algorithm. Prediction accuracy was tested on a blinded, independent rat blood test data set and ranged from 88.9\% to 95.8\%. Genomic markers outperformed predictions based on traditional clinical parameters. The expression profiles of the predictor genes from the patterns extracted from the blood exhibited remarkable (97\% accuracy) transtissue APAP exposure prediction when liver gene expression data were used as a test set. Analysis of human samples revealed separation of APAP-intoxicated patients from control individuals based on blood expression levels of human orthologs of the rat discriminatory genes. The major biological signal in the discriminating genes was activation of an inflammatory response after exposure to toxic doses of APAP. These results support the hypothesis that gene expression data from peripheral blood cells can provide valuable information about exposure levels, well before liver damage is detected by classical parameters. It also supports the potential use of genomic markers in the blood as surrogates for clinical markers of potential acute liver damage.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Many variants in the genome, including variants associated with disease, affect the expression of genes. These so-called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) can be used to gain insight in the downstream consequences of disease. While it has been shown that many disease-associated variants alter gene expression in a cell-type dependent manner, eQTL datasets for specific cell types may not always be available and their sample size is often limited. We present a method that is able to detect cell type specific effects within eQTL datasets that have been generated from whole tissues (which may be composed of many cell types), in our case whole blood. By combining numerous whole blood datasets through meta-analysis, we show that we are able to detect eQTL effects that are specific for neutrophils and lymphocytes (two blood cell types). Additionally, we show that the variants associated with some diseases may preferentially alter the gene expression in one of these cell types. We conclude that our method is an alternative method to detect cell type specific eQTL effects, that may complement generating cell type specific eQTL datasets and that may be applied on other cell types and tissues as well.},

However, an attractive feature of high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip manufacturing and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable, and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis methods. Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data, and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also present model-based methods for identifying and handling cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. Applications of these results will be presented elsewhere.},

Multiple cell types and brain areas are affected, but the impact of ASD mutations appears to be strongest in cortical interneurons, pyramidal neurons and the medium spiny neurons of the striatum, implicating cortical and corticostriatal brain circuits. In females, truncating ASD mutations on average affect genes with 50\textendash{}100\% higher brain expression than in males.

  abstract = {Dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are uniquely sensitive to degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) and its models. Although a variety of molecular characteristics have been proposed to underlie this sensitivity, one possible contributory factor is their massive, unmyelinated axonal arbor that is orders of magnitude larger than other neuronal types. We suggest that this puts them under such a high energy demand that any stressor that perturbs energy production leads to energy demand exceeding supply and subsequent cell death. One prediction of this hypothesis is that those dopamine neurons that are selectively vulnerable in PD will have a higher energy cost than those that are less vulnerable. We show here, through the use of a biology-based computational model of the axons of individual dopamine neurons, that the energy cost of axon potential propagation and recovery of the membrane potential increases with the size and complexity of the axonal arbor according to a power law. Thus SNc dopamine neurons, particularly in humans, whose axons we estimate to give rise to more than 1 million synapses and have a total length exceeding 4 m, are at a distinct disadvantage with respect to energy balance which may be a factor in their selective vulnerability in PD.},

  abstract = {The measurement of protein concentration in an aqueous sample is an important assay in biochemistry research and development labs for applications ranging from enzymatic studies to providing data for biopharmaceutical lot release. Spectrophotometric protein quantitation assays are methods that use UV and visible spectroscopy to rapidly determine the concentration of protein, relative to a standard, or using an assigned extinction coefficient. Methods are described to provide information on how to analyze protein concentration using UV protein spectroscopy measurements, traditional dye-based absorbance measurements; BCA, Lowry, and Bradford assays and the fluorescent dye-based assays; amine derivatization and detergent partition assays. The observation that no single assay dominates the market is due to specific limitations of certain methods that investigators need to consider before selecting the most appropriate assay for their sample. Many of the dye-based assays have unique chemical mechanisms that are prone to interference from chemicals prevalent in many biological buffer preparations. A discussion of which assays are prone to interference and the selection of alternative methods is included.},

  abstract = {Neuronal nuclei (NeuN) is a well-recognized ``marker'' that is detected exclusively in post-mitotic neurons and was initially identified through an immunological screen to produce neuron-specific antibodies. Immunostaining evidence indicates that NeuN is distributed in the nuclei of mature neurons in nearly all parts of the vertebrate nervous system. NeuN is highly conserved among species and is stably expressed during specific stages of development. Therefore, NeuN has been considered to be a reliable marker of mature neurons for the past two decades. However, this role has been challenged by recent studies indicating that NeuN staining is variable and even absent during certain diseases and specific physiological states. More importantly, despite the widespread use of the anti-NeuN antibody, the natural identity of the NeuN protein remained elusive for 17 years. NeuN was recently eventually identified as an epitope of Rbfox3, which is a novel member of the Rbfox1 family of splicing factors. This identification might provide a novel perspective on NeuN expression during both physiological and pathological conditions. This review summarizes the current progress on the biochemical identity and biological significance of NeuN and recommends caution when applying NeuN immunoreactivity as a definitive marker of mature neurons in certain diseases and specific physiological states.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
Results of array studies have suggested abnormalities in expression of lipid and myelin-related genes in schizophrenia. Here, we investigated oligodendrocyte-specific and myelination-associated gene expression in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder.
Methods
We used samples from the Stanley brain collection, consisting of 15 schizophrenia, 15 bipolar affective disorder, and 15 control brains. Indexing-based differential display PCR was done to screen for differences in gene expression in schizophrenia patients versus controls. Results were cross-validated with quantitative PCR, which was also used to investigate expression profiles of 16 other oligodendrocyte and myelin genes in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These genes were further investigated with an ongoing microarray analysis.
Findings
Results of differential display and quantitative PCR analysis showed a reduction of key oligodendrocyte-related and myelin-related genes in schizophrenia and bipolar patients; expression changes for both disorders showed a high degree of overlap. Microarray results of the same genes investigated by quantitative PCR correlated well overall.
Interpretation
Schizophrenia and bipolar brains showed downregulation of key oligodendrocyte and myelination genes, including transcription factors that regulate these genes, compared with control brains. These results lend support to and extend observations from other microarray investigations. Our study also showed similar expression changes to the schizophrenia group in bipolar brains, which thus lends support to the notion that the disorders share common causative and pathophysiological pathways.},

  abstract = {In the present study we have used guanosine 3\ensuremath{'}: 5\ensuremath{'}-phosphate-dependent protein kinase antiserum, a specific immunohistochemical marker for cerebellar Purkinje cells, [Lohmann, Walter, Miller, Greengard and De Camilli (1981) Proc. natn. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 653\textendash{}657], to carry out a detailed analysis of the architecture and projections of Purkinje cells in the adult rat. We have obtained a novel view of aspects of Purkinje cell morphology that were already known and, in addition, we have provided some new information, in particular on the targets of Purkinje cell axons and their pattern of innervation, and on the morphology and course of Purkinje cell axons. Furthermore, we have found a few cells positive for guanosine 3\ensuremath{'}: 5\ensuremath{'} phosphate-dependent protein kinase which are very similar morphologically to Purkinje cells but are located outside of the cerebellar cortex.

A unique feature of Purkinje cells is their peculiar monoplanar shape. Not only do their dendritic arbors lie in planes perpendicular to the major axis of the folia, but their axons, including the collaterals, also travel roughly in the same planes. Thus, Purkinje cells can be imagined as lying in longitudinal sheets radiating from the deep cerebellar nuclei. In these sheets, Purkinje cell axons originating from cells located at different rostrocaudal levels of the cortex converge towards the deep cerebellar nuclei without intersecting each other. It is as a result of this precise organization that Purkinje cell axons reach the deep cerebellar nuclei with a mediolateral and rostrocaudal topology that closely reflects the position of their parent cells in the cerebellar cortex. In the subcortical rays of white matter, Purkinje cell axons are interspersed with other axons, being excluded only from longitudinal strips which correspond to the cerebellar raphes. Upon converging towards the deep cerebellar nuclei they segregate into tracts of white matter that alternate with tracts of white matter from which they are excluded. The great majority of Purkinje cell axons terminate in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Recurrent collaterals terminate in close proximity to the Purkinje cell layer. Dense innervation by these axons is found around large interneurons (Lugaro and Golgi cells) and around the Purkinje cell pinceaux. No direct input of recurrent collaterals to Purkinje cell somata is evident in immunostained material.

A substantial number of Purkinje cell axons continue beyond the cerebellar nuclei to innervate nearby regions in the brain stem. The most prominently innervated extracerebellar target region is the dorsal part of the lateral vestibular nucleus, which is as heavily innervated by Purkinje axons as the deep cerebellar nuclei are. All the other major parts of the vestibular formation and some adjacent nuclei (including the parabrachial nuclei, the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract) are innervated to various degrees by Purkinje cells. In these regions heavily innervated cells are interspersed with cells which receive only a moderate degree of innervation and with cells which apparently lack Purkinje cell inputs. Upon reaching the deep cerebellar nuclei, axons destined to extracerebellar targets deviate from the planes of dendritic arborization of their parent cells. They converge into tight bundles which follow an irregular course and intersect each other to reach their targets. Axons travelling in the same bundle often appear to terminate on the same cell.

At all target sites Purkinje axons end as varicose terminals which synapse primarily with the perikarya and proximal dendrites of target cells. On the surface of these cells Purkinje cell terminals are often tightly apposed to form a compact mosaic. Both the course of Purkinje cell axons and their pattern of innervation of target cells are consistent with the possibility that contacts between Purkinje cells and their target neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei and the brain stem are established early in ontogenesis.

Purkinje cell-like cells positive for guanosine 3\ensuremath{'}:5\ensuremath{'}-phosphate-dependent protein kinase not located in the cerebellar cortex were found predominantly at the dorsal surface of the brain stem and, in particular, in the cortex of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. Only on exception were they found in the cerebellar medulla or in nearby noncortical regions of the brain stem. While some of these cells might be ectopies, the significance of Purkinje cell-like cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, a region strikingly similar in architecture to the cerebellar cortex, remains to be established.},

By eliminating the need for liquid handling, we can thereby screen up to 18,342 different antibody clones at a time and, because the clones are arrayed from master stocks, the same antibodies can be double spotted and screened simultaneously against 15 different antigens. We have used our technique in several different applications, including isolating antibodies against impure proteins and complex antigens, where several rounds of phage display often fail.

Here, we report that following influenza infection most effectors require signals from major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and CD70 during a late window well after initial priming to become memory. During this timeframe, effector cells must produce IL-2 or be exposed to high levels of paracrine or exogenously added IL-2 to survive an otherwise rapid default contraction phase. Late IL-2 promotes survival through acute downregulation of apoptotic pathways in effector T cells and by permanently upregulating their IL-7 receptor expression, enabling IL-7 to sustain them as memory T cells. This new paradigm defines a late checkpoint during the effector phase at which cognate interactions direct CD4 T-cell memory generation.},

  abstract = {Neurogenic transcription factors and evolutionarily conserved signalling pathways have been found to be instrumental in the formation of neurons. However, the instructive role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in neurogenesis remains unexplored. We recently discovered that miR-9* and miR-124 instruct compositional changes of SWI/SNF-like BAF chromatin-remodelling complexes, a process important for neuronal differentiation and function. Nearing mitotic exit of neural progenitors, miR-9* and miR-124 repress the BAF53a subunit of the neural-progenitor (np)BAF chromatin-remodelling complex. After mitotic exit, BAF53a is replaced by BAF53b, and BAF45a by BAF45b and BAF45c, which are then incorporated into neuron-specific (n)BAF complexes essential for post-mitotic functions. Because miR-9/9* and miR-124 also control multiple genes regulating neuronal differentiation and function, we proposed that these miRNAs might contribute to neuronal fates. Here we show that expression of miR-9/9* and miR-124 (miR-9/9*-124) in human fibroblasts induces their conversion into neurons, a process facilitated by NEUROD2. Further addition of neurogenic transcription factors ASCL1 and MYT1L enhances the rate of conversion and the maturation of the converted neurons, whereas expression of these transcription factors alone without miR-9/9*-124 was ineffective. These studies indicate that the genetic circuitry involving miR-9/9*-124 can have an instructive role in neural fate determination.},

Analysis of messenger RNA and protein-expression profiles of human tissues revealed conserved control of protein abundance, and integration of drug-sensitivity data enabled the identification of proteins predicting resistance or sensitivity. The proteome profiles also hold considerable promise for analysing the composition and stoichiometry of protein complexes.

CD103(+) DCs arise from FLT3-dependent DC precursors (preDCs), whereas CD11b(hi) DCs can arise either from preDCs or FLT3-independent monocytes. Functional characterization of these two lineages of CD11b(hi) DCs has been hindered by the lack of a widely applicable method to distinguish between them. We performed gene expression analysis of fractionated lung DCs from C57BL/6 mice and found that monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), including CD11b(hi)Ly-6C(lo) tissue-resident and CD11b(hi)Ly-6C(hi) inflammatory moDCs, express the complement 5a receptor 1/CD88, whereas preDC-derived conventional DCs (cDCs), including CD103(+) and CD11b(hi) cDCs, express dipeptidyl peptidase-4/CD26. Flow cytometric analysis of multiple organs, including the kidney, liver, lung, lymph nodes, small intestine, and spleen, confirmed that reciprocal display of CD88 and CD26 can reliably distinguish FLT3-independent moDCs from FLT3-dependent cDCs in C57BL/6 mice. Similar results were obtained when DCs from BALB/c mice were analyzed. Using this novel approach to study DCs in mediastinal lymph nodes, we observed that most blood-derived lymph node-resident DCs, as well as tissue-derived migratory DCs, are cDCs. Furthermore, cDCs, but not moDCs, stimulated naive T cell proliferation. We anticipate that the use of Abs against CD88 and CD26 to distinguish moDCs and cDCs in multiple organs and mouse strains will facilitate studies aimed at assigning specific functions to distinct DC lineages in immune responses.},

To better understand the reactive astrocyte state, we used Affymetrix GeneChip arrays to profile gene expression in populations of reactive astrocytes isolated at various time points after induction using two mouse injury models, ischemic stroke and neuroinflammation. We find reactive gliosis consists of a rapid, but quickly attenuated, induction of gene expression after insult and identify induced Lcn2 and Serpina3n as strong markers of reactive astrocytes. Strikingly, reactive astrocyte phenotype strongly depended on the type of inducing injury. Although there is a core set of genes that is upregulated in reactive astrocytes from both injury models, at least 50\% of the altered gene expression is specific to a given injury type. Reactive astrocytes in ischemia exhibited a molecular phenotype that suggests that they may be beneficial or protective, whereas reactive astrocytes induced by LPS exhibited a phenotype that suggests that they may be detrimental. These findings demonstrate that, despite well established commonalities, astrocyte reactive gliosis is a highly heterogeneous state in which astrocyte activities are altered to respond to the specific injury. This raises the question of how many subtypes of reactive astrocytes exist. Our findings provide transcriptome databases for two subtypes of reactive astrocytes that will be highly useful in generating new and testable hypotheses of their function, as well as for providing new markers to detect different types of reactive astrocytes in human neurological diseases.},

By comparing the gene expression profiles of similar but distinctive mental disorders, we explored the uniqueness of bipolar disorder and its similarity to other mental disorders at the molecular level. Notably, most of the altered gene expressions in each disease were not shared by one another, suggesting the molecular distinctiveness of these mental disorders. We found a tendency of downregulation of the genes encoding receptor, channels or transporters, and upregulation of the genes encoding stress response proteins or molecular chaperons in bipolar disorder. Altered expressions in bipolar disorder shared by other mental disorders mainly consisted of upregulation of the genes encoding proteins for transcription or translation. The genes identified in this study would be useful for the understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, as well as the common pathophysiological background in major mental disorders at the molecular level. In addition, we found the altered expression of LIM and HSPF1 both in the brains and lymphoblastoid cells in bipolar disorder. These genes may have pathophysiological importance and would be novel candidate genes for bipolar disorder.},

  note = {In this article, we have characterized and compared gene expression profiles from laser capture microdissected neurons in six functionally and anatomically distinct regions from clinically and histopathologically normal aged human brains. These regions, which are also known to be differentially vulnerable to the histopathological and metabolic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), include the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (limbic and paralimbic areas vulnerable to early neurofibrillary tangle pathology in AD), posterior cingulate cortex (a paralimbic area vulnerable to early metabolic abnormalities in AD), temporal and prefrontal cortex (unimodal and heteromodal sensory association areas vulnerable to early neuritic plaque pathology in AD), and primary visual cortex (a primary sensory area relatively spared in early AD). These neuronal profiles will provide valuable reference information for future studies of the brain, in normal aging, AD and other neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Summary
Transplantation of glial-rich neural progenitors has been demonstrated to attenuate motor neuron degeneration and disease progression in rodent models of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-mediated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, translation of these results into a clinical setting requires a renewable human cell source. Here, we derived glial-rich neural progenitors from human iPSCs and transplanted them into the lumbar spinal cord of ALS mouse models. The transplanted cells differentiated into astrocytes, and the treated mouse group showed prolonged lifespan. Our data suggest a potential therapeutic mechanism via activation of AKT signal. The results demonstrated the efficacy of cell therapy for ALS by the use of human iPSCs as cell source.},
